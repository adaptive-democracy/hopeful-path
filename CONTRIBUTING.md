**To make a contribution to the content of the book:**

The book chapters are located in the [`book` folder](/book) of this repository. The files are written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), a plain text format for writing webpage content.

To suggest a change to a chapter, find it in the folder above, and [use the edit button](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/managing-files-on-github/editing-files-in-your-repository) to make changes and suggest them to me in a pull request. The Github interface should be able to guide you through everything else.

If you'd like to better understand what git and Github are, check out these two pages:

- [Github Hello World intro](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- [GitHub for Non-Coders](https://brennan.io/2015/08/07/github-noncoders/)

**To make a contribution to the website code, including design changes:**

The site uses these technologies:

- The [nuxt vue framework](https://nuxtjs.org/), using the [static generation mode](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/features/deployment-targets#static-hosting).
- The [vue composition api](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html#why-composition-api) for the few components.
- [Nuxt content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) to query and render the book chapters.
- [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) using [just-in-time mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode) for styling.
- [Tailwind typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) to style the book chapter content.

Design contributions are especially welcome! I'm an awful designer and will take any help I can get.
