# Persistent Democracy

## The governmental structure<br>that can fix...<br>everything?

<!-- introduce yourself, and talk about what persistent democracy is: your best bet -->

---

how is this talk structured?

- very in depth
- broken into skippable chapters
- geared toward Effective Altruists, but not exclusively
- inspired by Glen Weyl and RxC, some review
- ordered for ease of understanding by a newcomer

---

answer these questions:

- why do we need Persistent Democracy?
- what is Persistent Democracy, and how does it work?
- how can we actually make it happen?
- why should Effective Altruists be especially interested?

<!--
persistent democracy, a broad overview

this talk has this structure:

- problems I think persistent democracy can solve
  - climate change (resolving gridlock, improving rights definitions, removing negative externalities, funding public goods)
  - two party system
  - space governance
  - software security
- how persistent democracy works
  persistent democracy builds on several existing ideas from the world of political economy, so there are sections marked "primer" that merely describe those existing ideas. feel free to skip those sections if you already understand that concept
  - quadratic voting -> persistent voting
  - range voting -> quadratic range voting
  - conviction voting -> persistent commitments
  - quadratic funding -> persistent funding
  - harberger taxes -> common resource taxes
- how we can incrementally achieve persistent democracy and use it to solve the above problems
- my proof sketch for why persistent democracy could be welfare optimal

# I'm convinced Persistent Democracy can solve these problems

- make cooperation efficient, maybe provably optimally
- make direct democracy possible
- efficiently negotiate ownership of all resources
- allow cooperatives to finally live up to their full potential
- scale democratic society as big as communication and travel allow

---

# we have the *duty* of hope

problems will not be solved unless we *stubbornly insist* on solving them

we must *assume* it is possible, and do what we can

- even small groups rely on cooperation to survive and thrive
- almost all problems are versions of cooperation failure

<!-- cooperation is humanity's superpower, our logical systems are foundational tools, ones that help us achieve all our other goals, and that can cause all our other problems. improving our logical systems for coordination allows us to improve everything else about society. persistent democracy is my best bet at a (possibly provably) best base system for democratic coordination -->

and of course all voting systems have the "deadline problem"

it's easy to flood an electorate with misinformation or propaganda in the strategic window right before an election deadline

this means that instead of options that have legitimate deep support in general winning, it's easy to game the system and make strategy the main decider of what happens

- resource voting system
- voters *move around* "weights" instead of *spending* "credits"
- voters can move around their weights at any time
- candidates can enter or exit an election at any time
- current winner is determined by who has the most weights

# ðŸ“– what are rights?

rights are just a system to decide what things we *can't* vote on

right set aside some things as **off limits**, things that we've decided aren't worth trading on markets or making more granular rules about

they're also a system to carve out different activities so they *can* be traded on markets

ultimately this is what constitutions are for, they more or less decide what rights everyone has, defining things people can and can't vote for

what decisions are made by the group? and exactly how?

allowing constitutions to be defined democratically means that the voters have *full* control over something. each of them can input an arbitrary amount of information into the system, since a constitutional document can define any rules imaginable

the rights we have are pretty obviously something we've just decided over time. you can possibly imagine crazy science fiction beings with dramatically different bodies/worlds than ours, and the rights they would define would be different!

a hint at why rights are useful: they basically allow us to find actions that are both undesirable and *difficult to reverse*, so we can preempt a lot of irreversible damage

# ðŸ“– public goods and cooperative goods

we all intuitively understand the idea of a private good. it's something a single person can tractably own and control by themselves, that provides value only to one person or small group of people at a time.

public goods are goods that provide a lot of benefit to *everyone*, but wouldn't provide a lot of value to individuals, at least enough to compensate for how expensive they are.

basically they're goods that don't make sense to trade on markets, either because of something about human psychology or just cost

public goods are really defined by whether or not it would ever make sense for a individual to pay for them themselves

if it wouldn't make sense for one person to buy by themselves, but it would *benefit* that individual if the good happened to already be available to them. basically if people can cooperate to provision a good, share the cost to provision it, and then get more value from it than they contributed, that's a public good.

public goods tend to be defined by *thresholds* of usefulness, situations where a good is worthless if done at a smaller scale, but immensely valuable if done past a certain threshold.

Cooperative goods are those that happen when people combine their contributions into a single good. Their individual contributions would be worthless, but there's a step change at some point that makes their combined worth immense

an uncontroversial claim: **our society does not properly provision public goods.** There are many more public goods that could be compatibly and usefully created. these public goods would create immense prosperity and welfare for everyone in society.
These public goods are missed opportunities for society


for any cooperative good
it has a total cost
it has a function that determines amount of benefit gained by one person compared with their amount of ownership of the good. cooperative goods tend to have either linear functions (where benefit of ownership decreases more slowly than amount of ownership) or step functions (where there is a threshold of amount of ownership above which almost all benefit of ownership is enjoyed)
so cooperative goods are those where the total cost and total ownership can be divided up in a way that makes the cost of ownership lower than the benefit of ownership for each owner
(can I own a piece of the good such that the benefit of owning the piece is greater than the cost of owning the piece)


I'm introducing the term "cooperative goods" to generally refer to this entire category of goods, ones where sharing the good improves the cost ratio for many people. public goods are different than club goods by the degree of enforceability, or in other words cost to exclude, and also to a degree by how much democratic value we place on the thing (it's important for *everyone* to have access to this thing regardless of whether or not they can or have the time or foresight to opt into it)

# ðŸ“– quadratic funding

## Quadratic Funding

##### Provably optimal!

<!-- TODO example -->

---

## Quadratic Funding

##### problems when:

- matching pool isn't big enough
- lots of spammy projects
- it's difficult to draw a line between projects that create public good and those that don't (what happens when a large group of people try to get quadratic funding for an initiative that will only profit them?)

layout: chapter-title
---

# ðŸ“– persistent funding

---

## Persistent Funding

Persistent Commitments + Quadratic Funding

uses democratic weights make a *default* prioritization of projects

persistent commitments allows the system to have *oversight*, so the quadratic matching algorithm doesn't turn into a mathematical dictator.
the algorithm is useful but not perfect, so it's merely one input into a process that at the end of the day is purely democratic.

---

## Persistent Funding

- uses persistent commitments rounds
- voters select a decision document
- can remove spammy projects
- can add extra money to the funding pool
- can choose to fund nothing!

## Persistent Funding

can prioritize projects that achieve the most social good (have the most weight)<br>compared to how much they would cost to match

# ðŸ“– crowdsell system and intellectual property

crowdsell system allows people to sell creative work of all kinds directly to society
could allow us to abolish intellectual property as a concept

can work both for projects that are finished and proposed work

finished projects basically just use something called assurance contracts

- a creator submits a description of work they've already done, sets a price, makes promises about what they've done
- people pledge
- if enough money is pledged then the promised work is released, there's a window where the pledgers can assert the work doesn't meet the promises, if they don't do this then the creator is given the money

proposed work is basically just a crowdfunding campaign with more oversight

- creator submits their plan, including a monthly budget and a "prize" amount
- people pledge
- if enough money is pledged then the project begins, and every budget cycle the pledgers can assert the creators aren't meeting the commitments of the project plan. if they do so then the project is halted and all undisbursed money is refunded at a prorate
- if the project runs past their budgeted plan, then the prize amount is eaten away. once the project is finished to the satisfaction of the pledgers then the prize amount is disbursed


intellectual property is a very slippery idea
you can't actually "own" intellectual work, you can merely assert that you in fact did the work
we've made intellectual work into property, but really it's labor

how can we reasonably define who deserves to own a piece of work?

# ðŸ“– understanding preferences

change the below analogy to choosing where to go eat as a group of friends. your feelings about different restaurants exists in a complex multi-dimensional space, where each option might be good for different things as different times (after you've exercised, when on a date, with your family, etc). but since we've narrowed the specificity of the choice it's possible to score the options on a single scale, "how enjoyable is this place to go with friends". 

however if we say "you can either choose where we go as friends or where you go with your family tomorrow", suddenly these choices don't exist on the same simple scale, or if they do the scale is much more general such as "how much do you care about this thing". you might be much more sensitive to your choice of restaurant when with your family than with your friends
perhaps its possible to say we could use scoring system all the time, but we have to introduce resource voting *somewhere* to overcome the strategic problems with score voting.

perhaps its as simple as the fact that similar options for the same choice can cannibalize each other in unproductive ways. it is *theoretically* possible to have both choice concern and option alignment use score voting, but then the entire system is 
the problem with comparable choice cannibalization is that if you score two things the same then you really just consider them equivalent and would prefer them to be merged into one choice. that's less realistic with incomparable choices, the two can't be "the same", and if that's really the case then you should *really* be voting at the constitutional level *above* these choices in order to rearrange them into a more logical shape


if I asked you to describe to me how much you like different ice cream flavors, what's the most natural way to most accurately describe your feelings? (say we're going to get ice cream as a group, and for constraints out of our control we can only get one flavor. when making this specific choice one really can score each choice on a scale of "how much happiness" you expect to get from that option, and options can vary widely, including being tied)
it's obviously by giving them all a score, with the scale being "degree of enjoyment".

- the scale goes negative
- the scale is *theoretically* unbounded, even once you get to transcendent ecstasy you can theoretically go further, but in practice most things fall into a normal range.
- different choices can be pretty far apart from each other

a simple ranking would pretty obviously do a bad job allowing you to describe your preferences. if you were describing your preferences informally and I forced you to use a ranking, you would almost certainly include a lot of "scoring context" so I actually understood what you mean

but what if I mixed in different car models?

different experiences are obviously different, eating ice cream is different, and incomparable, to riding in a car

<!-- what I think the internal structure of welfare preferences is. -->

difference between categorically comparable and incomparable options. different ice cream flavors can most likely be scored on a single scale together, since they're likely triggering a merely different degree of the same feeling. but comparing ice cream choices against models of car doesn't make sense, since they involve completely different aspects of experience and enjoyment. ice cream flavors and car models are in different clusters, different incomparable categories. this suggests we want something like range voting for comparable options and quadratic voting *across* groups of incomparable options. using rational numbers between 0-1 inclusive a system could model different gradations of preference with perfect accuracy, and using rational numbers that must add up to exactly 1 a system could model differences in preference intensity between options with perfect accuracy

# ðŸ“– persistent quadratic range voting

this exact combination of systems combines the strengths of range voting and quadratic voting.
quadratic voting is used to describe the different in relative *concern* between different elections. so quadratic voting is used to signal differences between categorically incomparable things. this is useful because the options are very unlikely to have "clone splitting", all the things being compared aren't substitutable
range voting is used to score options *within* an election, things that could be substitutable and are in the same category, so it allows conservation of accuracy even in the face of similar options

the problem with using no nomination systems and simply allowing all options with weights is that of noise and selection. in such a system, the only way candidates can gain attention from potential voters is through their own marketing or outreach, which inherently favors those with access to outreach resources, whatever they may be
we want it to be possible for genuinely good options to *gradually* gain the attention of the electorate through nothing but the ladder of attention from the lowest levels of excitement. once an option has genuine traction, we would like to present that option for everyone else's consideration, but only once its real. there would be too much noise otherwise.

Nomination thresholds and noise reduction in resource voting elections
Nomination thresholds should get more costly as:
Voters in the electorate increases
Voters in the election increases 
Existing nominees increases
Number of elections decreases?

the power of nomination buckets is that it makes is *always possible* for even an obscure choice to make it into mainstream attention, it might just take a while!

# ðŸ“– partial common ownership

or a brief rant about cumulative advantage, the wealth ratchet, and the inherent uselessness of landlording. should this section graze the ethical theory? if someone is born into a world where some small group has the legal right of ownership to almost everything, has this person really been born into a world where they can actually freely pursue their welfare and happiness to the same degree as others? ownership and control is an absolutely essential element of real freedom, but at the same time it's impossible for us to simply "calculate" how much everyone should have, since different people want different things. this is the single useful insight of market theory, but I think it's pretty easy to demonstrate that our ideas of property ownership, especially ownership of truly finite resources like land, both create inefficient markets and are inherently unethical. hint at future "libertarian hangover" talk

# ðŸ“– the power of cooperatives

<!-- the way the whole economy should be structured. democracy + markets, just the good parts. talk about history of cooperatives and why they haven't lived up to their full potential because of inefficient voting systems and seemingly intentional honey pot regulation. hint at the things we could cooperativize -->

cooperatives only have one big disadvantage, and only in an inefficiently profit-focused economy like ours: comparative difficulty raising *startup* capital. once a cooperative is operating at scale it can much more plausibly fund initiatives with saved capital from members or even through debt financing. but when it's very small that isn't as true. 
in an economy/society like ours where profit-seekers control almost all of the capital and only wish to deploy that capital to seek further profits (rather than creating true market value in the form of consumer surplus or prosperity or progress) it will be difficult to get some of that capital to create cooperatives that could out-compete profit-seeking companies.
it seems fairly obvious to me this isn't an *inherent* structural disadvantage of the cooperative model, but one that only exists in societies like ours that don't properly tax property and don't properly provision public goods. in a society that properly provisions public goods and prevents property-based wealth ratchet, there will be lots of capital in public hands ready to use to create new startup cooperatives, for example using something like persistent funding.

cooperative bonds? what are the regulatory difficulties in raising debt capital?

#### Persistently Democratic Cooperative

##### Cooperative?

<v-clicks>

- cooperatives are private companies owned by their members<br>(workers or users or both)
- cooperatives are a proven model
- cooperatives haven't lived up to their potential

</v-clicks>

---

#### Persistently Democratic Cooperative

- journalism and news media?
- social media?
- cloud computing?
- ecommerce?
- media streaming?
- internet service?
- manufacturing?

- surveillance and recommender systems. the social problems created by large tech firms, especially those related to media and information, have become pressing and obvious. many people discuss how to solve these problems by somehow reforming the companies or regulations, but I think the *real* solution to these problems is quite obvious, cooperative ownership. the real problem at the heart of problematic companies of all kinds (not only tech companies) is that the incentives of the companies aren't aligned with those of their customers or society at large. cooperative ownership directly solves the problem of alignment with customers (since they are the owning decision-makers), and obliquely solves the problem of alignment with society since membership in a cooperative is open.

# ðŸ“– persistent democracy and Effective Altruism

# persistent democracy is very compatible with EA

## could be a valuable tool in achieving EA goals

- global health and development (improve governance and coordination)
- climate change, biosecurity and pandemic prevention, nuclear security (global coordination and new public goods)
- space governance (persistent constitutions and common resource rights)

<v-click>

- AI alignment
  - superhuman AI precipice (improve governance and deliberation)
  - **automation precipice**

</v-click>

<!--  
it's pretty obvious that most global health and development problems are really just examples of coordination failure and resource inequality, and it should be pretty obvious that the only truly robust and scalable solutions to those problems are ones that allow the effected people to coordinate to solve the problems themselves.

pretty obvious relationship, these all require global coordination and new public goods

persistent constitutions and common resource rights could very plausibly govern a global or multi-planet society. the fluidity of these systems would make it quite straightforward to decide how to divide space resources, either by placing them into shared public governance as is done with things like national parks, or simply using markets driven by common resource taxes to fluidly decide ownership.
-->

# automation precipice

- quite weak AI could still render most people economically useless and militarily powerless
- concentration of this power in too few hands could cause many problems
- ethically precarious for many reasons

<v-click>

- persistent democracy could plausibly cooperativize ownership of AI systems
- could ensure benefits are widely shared

</v-click>

# cooperative bootstrapping should receive EA funding

- grants for research or infrastructure
- low or zero interest loans for scaling
- scaled cooperatives are self-sustaining

<!-- 
cooperatives have the potential to indirectly solve many other societal problems. wealth inequality and corporate misalignment have many knock-on effects in terms of how they negatively impact culture and deliberation and values and global health. for example, a facet of problems like obesity is the fact that food manufacturers have misaligned incentives.

this is where EA organizations (or any altruistic organizations) have the opportunity to step in. if we can get a critical mass of cooperatives to the point where they're operating at scale, then we can be fairly confident they can take it from there. this means grants or low or zero interest loans to scaling cooperatives is a very good impact investment
in general I think persistent democracy is a very convincing EA initiative. EA has generally centered around utilitarian ethics and a desire to maximize welfare, and I can think of few better ways to do so than to improve coordination efficiency in a way that allows any person to fairly express their preferences.
I have much more specific theoretical claims about the possible welfare optimality of persistent democracy, and I'll make those in my next talk. I think there's a strong chance persistent democracy is optimal
