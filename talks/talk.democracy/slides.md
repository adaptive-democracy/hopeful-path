I'm going to steal the apple basic theme stuff, fix some of the annoying things, and make my own layouts

layouts
- cover, the first slide
- chapter-title, where # is big, ## is subtitle, paragraph is big but just normal description
- the normal default layout, for normal slides, which will need some "hook" for the chapter marker. this layout needs to be able to handle normal images

# Persistent Democracy

## The governmental structure<br>that can fix...<br>everything?

<!-- introduce yourself, and talk about what persistent democracy is: your best bet -->

---

how is this talk structured?

- very in depth
- broken into skippable chapters
- geared toward Effective Altruists, but not exclusively
- inspired by Glen Weyl and RxC, some review
- ordered for ease of understanding by a newcomer

---

answer these questions:

- why do we need Persistent Democracy?
- what is Persistent Democracy, and how does it work?
- how can we actually make it happen?

<!--
persistent democracy, a broad overview

this talk has this structure:

- problems I think persistent democracy can solve
  - climate change (resolving gridlock, improving rights definitions, removing negative externalities, funding public goods)
  - two party system
  - space governance
  - software security
- how persistent democracy works
  persistent democracy builds on several existing ideas from the world of political economy, so there are sections marked "primer" that merely describe those existing ideas. feel free to skip those sections if you already understand that concept
  - quadratic voting -> persistent voting
  - range voting -> quadratic range voting
  - conviction voting -> persistent commitments
  - quadratic funding -> persistent funding
  - harberger taxes -> common resource taxes
- how we can incrementally achieve persistent democracy and use it to solve the above problems
- my proof sketch for why persistent democracy could be welfare optimal

# I'm convinced<br>Persistent Democracy<br>can solve these problems

- make cooperation efficient, maybe provably optimally
- make direct democracy possible
- efficiently negotiate ownership of all resources
- allow cooperatives to finally live up to their full potential
- scale democratic society as big as communication and travel allow

# we have the *duty* of hope

problems will not be solved unless we *stubbornly insist* on solving them

- almost all problems are versions of cooperation failure

<!-- cooperation is humanity's superpower, our logical systems are foundational tools, ones that help us achieve all our other goals, and that can cause all our other problems. improving our logical systems for coordination allows us to improve everything else about society. persistent democracy is my best bet at a (possibly provably) best base system for democratic coordination -->

# Persistent Voting

- resource voting system
- voters *move around* "weights" instead of *spending* "credits"
- voters can move around their weights at any time
- candidates can enter or exit an election at any time
- current winner is determined by who has the most weights

## could solve tons of problems!

<v-click>

- prevent stress and overload
- stabilize decisions

- can give special extra weights to elected experts
- can combine methods like sortition, approval voting, etc

##### possible problems?

- only my left shoe was bought:<br>you can "bind together" property
- national parks shouldn't be for sale:<br>constitutions can set aside some things
- have to choose between high taxes and voting:<br>probably a good idea to separate "legislative" and "administrative" weights

## My tentative plan

#### Persistently Democratic Cooperative

- cooperatives are a proven model
- cooperatives haven't lived up to their potential

## My tentative plan

#### Persistently Democratic Cooperative

##### this is how we really start to change things

<v-clicks>

- can afford to fail
- can build economic power without waiting for permission or reform
- can expand to arbitrary markets, solve arbitrary private problems
- could reclaim science, technology, and industrial scale

</v-clicks>
