## just proof *sketches*

- I'm an engineer, not an academic
- proofs â‰  applications
- convincing *enough* to move forward
- I'm not satisfied with not mechanized proofs

<!-- I'm not going to be perfectly thorough -->

- first idealized, easy to understand arguments
- shift closer to reality, changes preserve arguments


universe is grid
objects are stackable
beings experience welfare based on spot objects

start with rivalrous spots, rivalrous objects, instant teleportation of beings and any unclaimed objects, no fields, no interactions
the grid doesn't matter because of teleportation, it's really just a list of beings
if beings merely have some "price" for each type of object, and combinations of objects aren't meaningful to them then simple bidding is good enough
pretty sure quadratic scaling wouldn't improve things here, since groups can't meaningfully cooperate
*instantaneous resource vote*. dibs system of ownership would be unfair and favor "earlier" or more greedy beings, since accumulation is structurally reinforced

depending on the nature of beings it might be true that different combinations of objects are needed for some welfare, and so it still might make sense for groups to work together and create abstracting functions
*instantaneous quadratic Harberger auction* for objects
I'm not sure if this auction style is really just a composition of simpler pieces. it doesn't really matter

add fields and interactions
still no negative externalities because of instant teleportation
grid matters again
*instantaneous quadratic Harberger auction* for both objects and spaces (in the real universe spaces and objects are the same thing in the end, just concepts derived from the state of universe variables)

add costs to move and mutate, possibly asymmetric, so removing teleportation
this creates switching costs, which is what justifies stabilization periods
also here it makes sense to think about economic systems. money is a useful social technology at these stage because it can measure these costs to move and mutate, and to trade those costs across time and beings. concept of leverage is useful
*persistent quadratic Harberger auction*

make beings composed of objects, so beings experiencing welfare at all must be intrinsically abstracted
*persistent constitution*, or just persistent democracy
this is what necessitates the concept of rights
importantly, any particular system of rights isn't inevitable, any group of beings will have to figure out what they care about on average. this is why constitutions can be arbitrarily complex

add costs to coordinate, both economic and psychological
this means the group has to set aside time and resources to even have this system
it also means it can't happen every time step, so its decisions need to have a longer effect




# universe of beings and objects

- objects and beings exist
- beings can teleport
- each grid space can only be occupied by one thing
- objects in an empty universe
- objects can instantly change state
- objects can't be destroyed

# experience and welfare

perhaps objects don't interact with each other or change when combined
or if objects can't be shared in any way
if so a simple bid is likely best

we don't need *any* kind of coordination mechanism if objects are perfectly non-rivalrous

objects can still be stacked, but only one being per space

what if objects create *fields* of effect rather than only effecting the space they're on? then we've produced externalities

if beings can't teleport but have to move space by space and therefore "fences" of beings or objects can be created then suddenly we've produced exclusion


---

some objects will work better as a group
perhaps only to some group of beings

weight interleaving

---

abstracting functions
provide access to some group of objects in a simpler way, a way that allows beings to benefit from them without thinking about their full complexity

---

## conjecture

#### instantaneous quadratic auction is optimal for any set of beings and objects

---

## coordination costs

what if the choice procedure takes time to conduct?
what if the choice procedure requires objects?

equivalent to time for voting, and taxes/dues for supporting the organization

depending on how long/costly the process is, they'll want to conduct it less often and have its decisions last longer
for any coordination method there will be some optimal trade-off given the costs of all beings, and they can agitate for more or less

---

## switching costs

what if objects take time to be moved or mutated?





what if objects are more difficult to move into some states than others?
what if beings are composed of objects? can't teleport instantly anymore. can themselves be mutated or destroyed

destroying an object is like mutating it into a state it can never be changed out of



first really intuitive proof sketches with simpler objects and metaphors

universe as a bunch of objects that can change state and give people welfare
people can teleport anywhere instantly
the universe loop
all these beings want to cooperate with each other, so they select a function (logical algorithm or computer program). how can they do this best?
they can just try to own things individually, but if there are any kinds of predictable patterns in ownership or more complex functions for groups of objects then they can buy as a group and assign a more complex function, one they predict will be better
for example if a group of objects is found to work better when put together, at least for some group of beings, then those beings can bid for those objects together and choose a function they think will best allow them to benefit from the grouping (such as taking turns for equal amounts of time)

an instantaneous Harberger auction would be best at this stage.

in this overly simplified version

- *Coordination costs:*
- *Switching costs:*
- *Reversal costs:*

- *No market power:* everything is up for the auction at every time step, so no agent is able to artificially control anything. if they want continued control over the thing they have to use their weights. continued control isn't monopoly, it's the democratic will
- *No negative externalities:* because there are no switching or reversal costs (as a result of being able to instantly go somewhere else if unable to attain something) then yes
- *Perfect information:* assuming the beings are able to perfectly predict their own welfare outcomes then yes.






prediction?


philosophy and ethics stuff at the end

open questions:
is there a difference between giving each being an income of spendable credits every time step vs doing persistent? it feels like it as a result of strategy windows and the "broke" problem. having spendable credits implies *savable* credits. if you can save you can delay gratification. so weights instead merely represent your *current* share of capacity, rather than being discontinuous across time
should someone refraining from the discourse in one time step give them more power in future time steps?
spendable credits creates an intractable strategic problem. suddenly you have to not just consider the *visible* preferences of those who have weighed in, but the invisible preferences of all currently saved credits
there's a similar smaller problem with unallocated weights, but it would be smaller since that number will never increase
what if all the participants know how many weights/credits different people have saved?
persistent weights emphasize cooperation and stability, spendable credits emphasize scheming and strategy
this reasoning makes me *feel* like persistent weights would be on the whole better, but I don't have a solid argument why
