# resource voting removes spam voting

votes signal **concern** and **confidence**

<v-clicks>

- votes are finite
- choosing one thing more means choosing another less
- choosing one thing means you care more about it
- makes voting a true negotiation
- *negative* votes allow non-experts to give useful information

</v-clicks>

# no weird rules to buffer spam voting

## resource voting methods *actually* accomplish<br>what "representative democracy" *pretends* to accomplish

- filibuster
- senate
- congressional districts
- electoral college
- supreme court
- presidential veto

---

# shouldn't overcompensate!

- don't want *only* passionate opinions to decide everything
- casual opinions still have useful information, should still matter

# why square root?

<!--
saying "I want more probability to win please" makes it more and more likely you *will* win
and it increases it linearly
this means the cost you impose on others *increases* as you get more and more votes
the cost you impose on others increases quadratically

a stronger vote is more "painful" to others

when you get what you want in an election, you impose a harm on others in the form that they didn't get what they wanted
Quadratic Voting is based on the idea that you must compensate other members of society for the harm you impose on them
in this situation you compensate them for losing in one election with a greater possibility of winning in *another* election
-->

- "compensates" other voters for increased probability of losing
- roughly `n¬≤` relationships between `n` people

# Quadratic Voting

> [Quadratic Voting] achieves a perfect balance between the free-rider and the tyranny of the majority problems.<br>
> If the cost of voting increased more steeply, say, as the fourth power of votes cast, those with strong preferences would vote too little and we would revert to a partial tyranny of the majority.<br>
> If the cost of voting increased more slowly, those with intense preferences would have too much say, as a partial free-rider problem would prevail.

# resource voting isn't good enough

*weird surprising outcomes*: a very small number of voters can change an election

---

# resource voting isn't good enough

*meta problem*: what decisions do we even make in the first place?

---

# hard deadlines aren't good enough

- voter suppression is easy
- marketing and misinformation are cheap and effective
- voter turnout is incredibly important
- "election hangovers" are common
- weird surprises are irreversible

# Adaptive Democracy by example

- city (small scope, far future)
- country (large scope, far future)
- cooperative (near future)

<v-click>

- stable
- humanely paced
- truly democratic
- arbitrarily flexible
- allows expert delegation

</v-click>

---

# Adaptive Democracy

- adaptive voting
- adaptive commitments
- adaptive constitutions

---

# Adaptive Voting

- finite supply of "voting weights" you "place" on different decisions
- weights are "moved" rather than "spent"
- can use more weights on some decisions than others
- can move weights at any time
- candidates can enter/exit at any time

<v-click>

- not tiring: *periodic update schedule*
- not unstable: *stabilization buckets*
- not noisy: *nomination buckets*

</v-click>

---

# Adaptively Democratic city

- dislike current district attorney
- friend is parks commissioner
- want to nominate new police chief

---

# where to vote?

voting office (same building as post office and library)

- proctor checks your id (was free and easy to get)
- private booth with a voting computer
- view all elections and your current votes
- change your votes

[Adaptive Logistics](https://adaptivedemocracy.institute/adaptive-logistics)

---

# when to vote?

*update schedule* of one week (every Monday at 1:00 am)

instead of publishing changes immediately...

![](/drawing-5-instantaneous-updates.png)

---

# when to vote?

... only once a week (every Monday at 1:00 am)

![](/drawing-6-reasonable-updates.png)

---

# when to vote?

- it's only useful to vote once a week at most
- you usually do it Tuesday evening after grocery shopping
- if you don't want to change anything you don't bother

---

# how to vote?

elections use "stabilization buckets"

![](/drawing-7-stabilization-buckets.png)

---

# how to vote?

stabilization buckets ensure voters are confident in a change

![](/drawing-7-stabilization-buckets.png)

---

# how to vote?

stabilization buckets are "bigger" (more stable) if:

- election potentially effects more people
- electorate is more "spread thin", have more available elections

---

# how to vote?

- ‚úÖ move many weights onto district attorney
- ‚úÖ move some weights onto parks commissioner

---

# how to vote?

also use "nomination buckets"

![](/drawing-nomination-buckets-before.png)

---

# how to vote?

nomination buckets can prevent nonsense candidates and noisy elections

<!-- TODO -->
![](/drawing-nomination-buckets-before.png)

---

# how to vote?

can't clutter elections on a whim

![](/drawing-nomination-buckets-after.png)

---

# how to vote?

nomination buckets are sized like stabilization buckets

get more "difficult" if:

- election potentially impacts more people
- actual current amount of election noise increases:
  - more candidates already nominated
  - more nominees competing

---

# how to vote?

- ‚úÖ move some weights onto police chief nomination

---

# why is Adaptive Voting exciting?

<v-clicks>

- all benefits of resource voting
- low voter engagement not a problem! "delegation by abstention"
- removes election hangovers, other regret
- massively increases propaganda cost
- decreases horse-race effect

# Adaptive *Documents*

---

# Adaptively Democratic country

- needs a top-level constitution
- Adaptive Voting is flexible enough to choose one democratically!

---

# voters can propose documents

- propose in entirety (no random inconsistent amendments)
- can work together to merge compatible documents into one candidates
- voters can view "diffs" between similar documents

---

# voters can propose documents

constitution I would propose

- define rights in order to prevent irreversible harm<br>*(rights aren't different across the country)*
- split off legal codes
- split off agencies/officials
- split off budget
- split off district map, including protected areas

# constitution splitting

# constitutional districts

---

# constitutional tree

![](/drawing-constitution-tree.png)

levels would effect stabilization buckets

---

# many levels and many decisions

- rights and law
- local zoning
- environment
- hunting/fishing
- tax rates
- reducing personal taxes

lots of ideas! [adaptivedemocracy.institute](https://adaptivedemocracy.institute/)

---

# allows arbitrarily flexible governance

- delegate officials and experts, even partially
- split up distinct parts of governance
- allow voting weights to be used in many ways

---

# creates a true democracy

- every voter has the same potential impact on every decision

  *if not directly then through an elected official or constitution*
- expert delegations have democratic legitimacy

  *experts can only optimize within their domain, still need to be accountable*
- every voter can give unbounded information in documents

  *won't become noisy because of voting weights and nomination*

---

# realistic experimental plan

need to validate first!

- very novel
- extremely speculative
- extremely different

can validate in low-stakes private organizations

---

# Adaptively Democratic cooperative

## cooperatives are central to my theory of change

---

# what's a cooperative?

<v-clicks>

- cooperatives are private companies owned by their members<br>(workers or users or both)
- cooperatives are a proven model
- cooperatives haven't lived up to their potential

could help us solve more pressing problems:

- for-profit media
- platform monopolies
- corporatism
- consumerism

</v-clicks>

---

# Adaptively Democratic cooperative

- select a top-level constitution
- can pursue any initiative members want
- can vote over the internet
- can afford to fail

lots more at [adaptivedemocracy.institute](https://adaptivedemocracy.institute/)

# true democracy is a moral imperative

<v-clicks>

- true democracy = equal input weight
- equal *moral* weight implies equal *input* weight
- many different areas of expertise
- many different things to optimize
- can you decide who's "expert enough" to have a voice?
- balanced and reasonable democracy is the best you can do!

</v-clicks>

---

# true democracy is a moral imperative

- resource voting systems ensure votes signal real preferences
- adaptive constitutions ensure every person has input on everything

<v-clicks>

every person doesn't have to vote on every decision!

but they should be *able* to, even if indirectly

</v-clicks>

# "function-comparing" ethics

- new ethical theory
- utilitarianism without the crazy conclusions
- focuses on "subject blind" democracy
