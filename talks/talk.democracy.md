# Democracy doesn't have to suck

## How Persistent Democracy can help us solve all our big problems.

---

bunch of problems

- tyranny of the majority
- lesser of two evils
- toxic polarized culture
- apathetic voters
- uninformed voters
- voter disenfranchisement
- misinformation
- election hangovers
- unaccountable officials
- NIMBY-ism

---

is sane democracy simply impossible?

do people just suck too much?

---

not *causes*

but *symptoms*

---

the real problem?

## poor voting methods

---

we can use math and logic to build *provably* better voting methods

---

first offender:

# Plurality Voting

---

# Plurality Voting is awful

---

democracy != plurality voting

---

approval voting is much better!

part of a general group of systems I'll call "score systems"

solves spoiler effect

(note, systems like ranked choice voting *don't*, that's a subject for a different talk)

---

not good enough

doesn't account for preference strength

allows vote spam

---

quadratic voting is better

part of a general group of systems I'll call "resource systems"

solves "vote spam"

would solve things like NIMBY-ism

---

not good enough

allows "savings strategies"

---

deadline problem
I want to convince you that a key of unraveling this question is to find a way to get rid of all unnecessary election deadlines

---

persistent voting

---

lots of slides discussing benefits and details
ask people to be patient as you go through these important details

---

briefly say you'll talk about persistent commitments in a second

---

persistent constitutions

---

extended example of a country that uses it, far in the future
first go through someone going to a voting office
starting with election for constitution
the constitution directly defines rights so they aren't different all over the place
it splits off documents for districts, rights clarifications, and agencies/officials
go through a process of different drafts adopting easy to agree on compromises and therefore getting stronger
then discuss bits of districts, agencies (does the county auditor actually need to be an elected position?)
discuss how stabilization buckets relate to depth in constitutional tree

---

lots of other stuff:

- common resource rights
- persistent funding
- intellectual property
- provably optimal?

---

plan to make it a reality
