# why square root?

compensating other voters for marginal cost of losing

# roughly `nÂ²` relationships between `n` people

go dig in if you are curious

![](/drawing-4-tug-of-war.png)

a stronger vote is more "painful" to others

<!-- Instead it is that each individual must pay an amount equal to the cost that her actions impose on others. -->

when you get what you want in an election, you impose a harm on others in the form that they didn't get what they wanted
quadratic voting is based on the idea that you must compensate other members of society for the harm you impose on them
in this situation you compensate them for losing in one election with a greater possibility of winning in *another* election

this talk isn't about that!

# quadratic voting

balances "tyranny of the majority" against "free riding"

- people who care a lot aren't given complete control

# quadratic voting

> [Quadratic Voting] achieves a perfect balance between the free-rider and the tyranny of the majority problems.
> If the cost of voting increased more steeply, say, as the fourth power of votes cast, those with strong preferences would vote too little and we would revert to a partial tyranny of the majority.
> If the cost of voting increased more slowly, those with intense preferences would have too much say, as a partial free-rider problem would prevail.

# Persistent Voting

- finite supply of "voting weights" you "place" on different decisions
- weights are "moved" rather than "spent"
- can use more weights on some decisions than others
- can move weights at any time
- candidates can enter/exit at any time

- not tiring: *periodic update schedule*
- not unstable: *stabilization buckets*
- not noisy: *nomination buckets*

---

# Persistently Democratic city

- dislike current district attorney
- good friend is parks commissioner
- want to nominate new police chief

<!-- move to new city, make friends join communities, you decide you care about -->

# how to vote?

elections use "stabilization buckets"

![](/drawing-7-stabilization-buckets.png)

<!--
- If a candidate pulls ahead of the current winner, they begin to fill up some "stabilization bucket". They must fill up the entire bucket to become the new current winner of the position.
- If a candidate has a bigger vote advantage they fill up the stabilization bucket faster. This means the change will happen faster since the electorate is more "certain".
- If a candidate loses their vote advantage, the stabilization bucket begins to drain based on the size of the new gap.
-->

---

# how to vote?

stabilization buckets ensure voters are confident in a change

![](/drawing-7-stabilization-buckets.png)

---

# how to vote?

stabilization buckets are "bigger" or more stable if:

- election potentially effects more people
- electorate is more "spread thin", they have more elections they can possibly vote in

# how to vote?

- âœ… move many weights onto district attorney
- âœ… move some weights onto parks commissioner

---

# how to vote?

![](/drawing-nomination-buckets-after.png)

---

# how to vote?

nomination buckets are sized almost like stabilization buckets, get more "difficult" if:

- election potentially impacts more people
- actual current amount of election noise increases:
  - more candidates already nominated
  - more nominees competing

---

# how to vote?

- âœ… move some weights onto police chief nomination

# why could Persistent Voting be an improvement?

- all benefits of resource voting
- low voter engagement not a problem! "delegation by abstention"

- split up distinct parts of governance
- allow voting weights to be used in many ways

---

# creates a true democracy

- every voter has the same potential impact on every decision

  *if not directly then through an elected official or constitution*
- expert delegations have democratic legitimacy

  *experts can only optimize within their domain, still need to be accountable*
- every voter can give unbounded information in documents

  *won't become noisy because of voting weights and nomination*

# Persistently Democratic cooperative

## cooperatives are central to my theory of change

- would select a top-level constitution
- can pursue any initiative members want
- can vote over the internet
- can afford to fail

# what's a cooperative?

<v-clicks>

- cooperatives are private companies owned by their members<br>(workers or users or both)
- cooperatives are a proven model

people aren't stupid
people just aren't experts on every topic
people know best what they want, and things like "revealed vs stated" preferences are just as easily explained by exploitative systems rather than irrationality

you can redesign the lunchroom such that people will have different behavior. you can think of this as technocratic "development expertise". but you can also remember that if the users of that lunchroom want to be healthier, and you present the initiative to redesign it in the hopes to help them be healthier, then if they're given time to think about it and let the slow aspirational part of their mind make the decision

if they *don't* want to be healthier, then there's probably something else going on you don't understand!
insisting the things *you* care about be optimized without any concern for what other people want is the peak of moral arrogance

talk about anti-politics machine examples
you can't just insist everyone get on board with your program to

this is all probably making me sound like a market-absolutist libertarian. that's not true! I do think the underlying *flavor* of reasoning is shared, but I'm willing to accept that markets *as we understand them* aren't actually welfare-optimal and could be improved in ways that would make them "feel" more socialist








































EA should be improving Democracy and building cooperatives. Charitable giving is just a stop-gap.
<!-- We can only truly improve the world by improving Democracy. Charitable giving is nothing more than a stop-gap. -->

It is impossible to improve the state of the world without first fixing democratic systems, because all forms of aggregating utilitarianism are nonsensical.

This post is largely a response to this:
https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-the-anti-politics
I agree with the thrust of the criticism, but think this doesn't go nearly far enough.

If I had to point my finger at the main philosophical mistake I believe EA makes, it's the general acceptance of some kind of "universal view" utilitarianism. I've been working on an alternate axiology, but I'll just do a bad job of explaining it here to stand as a contrast.

TODO

when we do direct cash transfers, we're basically just implementing a rough version of a continuous wealth tax. when we do various public good producing programs, we're *hopefully* building public goods people would build for themselves if they had the resources and coordination tools.

even improving science/meta-science naturally flows from improving democracy, since science can be a public good, and better democracies will better support and incentivize public goods.
charitable giving is just a not-as-good version of a continuous inequality-dynamic externality-based wealth tax (if no one in the world was severely cut off from modern technology and could at any time pursue education programs then maybe it would make sense to just spend your money on fancy homes and vacations)

there's the "type theory" version of the argument (that allowing comparison of distinct qualia/welfare types is undefined without an axiomatic assumption) and the more obvious humble version (you can't assume you know what's best for people, you have to not just ask them but truly give them full equal power/input)


It seems obvious to me that a future where quadrillions of beings are immensely wealthy and happy but some (even tiny!) number of beings don't have a full democratic voice that *could* is an unacceptable situation that would be better morally traded for a much less prosperous future where everyone *does* have full democratic voice
we use words like "slave" to indicate these situations to indicate the gap between possibility and reality. if a society has slaves then conscious decisions have been made to subjugate people, and it's clear different choices could be made immediately to improve subject-blindness.

if a society allows the possibility of someone mistakenly getting trapped on a desert island and therefore having no democratic voice, well that's almost uncertainly an unavoidable tragedy. no one *chose* to make it happen, and the fact it happened was *in spite* of proper democratic equality, and likely happened as a result of peoples' willing choices and risks. things like that likely happen strictly less than a world in which people *don't* have equal democratic voice, because they can be forced into situations they wouldn't choose themselves.

this is the crux: it doesn't matter if a society is massively wealthy and prosperous if they make choices that deprive people of democratic voice

if you asked me if I would choose to either inhabit a prosperous world created by *chosen* subject-aware suffering before my time or a much less prosperous world preceded by subject-blindness (or to not exist at all), I think it's my moral obligation to choose the subject-blind version.

My main critique here is that we *still* don't escape from the "development lens". Qualitiative research isn't good enough. Just "asking people" isn't good enough. Those people should *be in charge*, they should have equal democratic voice to push for the things they actually want. That won't magically fix everything, because even a community that fully knows what it wants will make flawed predictions about what will actually *achieve* what they want.
randomized controled trials are useful, but only if they're being conducted *by* the people they will effect (or at least under their supervision)

the problem is that we *also* can't just force democratic systems on people! it seems the best we can do is experiment with systems ourselves, and if they actually work better people will copy them. if we can't build systems that solve our *own* problems, we certainly can't systems that solve others'

this isn't to say we should never do aid work. we should, but only as a stop gap. it seems to me the only *real* solution to the problem of global inequality is a [global wealth tax](TODO). but it seems much more of our effort should be spent building flexible and dynamic systems that could theoretically be applied anywhere (and then test the bejesus out of them to see what our theory missed)

the most obvious criticism of this post is that it could benefit *me*, because I want to do work to build Persistent Democracy. I fully recognize that criticism! But honestly, if someone else just took up that program and completely ignored me I wouldn't mind that, as long as I thought their work/conclusions were good. I don't care! I have lots of other things I can work on. But I'm very convinced democracy is the thing that matters, and specifically Persistent Democracy has the best chance I can imagine to maximize its potential.

the goal of persistent democracy is to be a system that if used by *any* group of people in *any* environment/universe would lead to welfare-optimal cooperation. it's not an accident that the *core* constructs of persistent democracy are extremely minimal and unopinionated, and that they are broadly close to market structures (importantly, they're inspired by markets but aren't "true" markets as we typically understand them)

the only predictive model that can robustly have any predictive weight is one that directly incorporates the inputs of those effected. their models can be incorrect, but that's why we gather *all* their input so hopefully some error cancels out, and over time people can observe the difference between their predictions and reality. if you think you have the answer and can update their models, then that's why you can present your case to them and maybe persuade them, and if you're unable to persuade them it's more likely they have some contextual knowledge they haven't figured out how to share with you rather than they are simply *all* deceived.





Exploring function-comparing ethics vs person-comparing ethics

https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LPDyAvwYyp4tzPmED/common-sense-cases-where-hypothetical-future-people-matter

you can only help future people by building *general systems* that are structurally capable of helping anyone. "anyone" is allowed to be narrow if your system is very grounded in a specific context, but the system you build should probably therefore be highly adaptable so it can respond to changes in that context.
all of these cases rely on how you act *in relation to the state of the world*. stewardship of the *universe* and the structures that
the subject-blind function-oriented ethical frame preserves the *intuitive* motivations of longtermism without allowing the repugnant conclusions implied by *any* form of aggregating utilitarianism

if on the other hand you're trading between harming a person now to help a person later, the *real* reason you don't harm the person now is because that course of action preserves option value for you to do both not harm the person now *and* help the person later!
*harming* a person both now or in the future is also morally equivalent! however the *only* people you can concretely help or harm exist in the present, by definition at all timesteps. you can only act toward people in the future by effecting the *world* now. your actions should be evaluated by how they treat *everyone* in a subject-blind way.

https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/HyeTgKBv7DjZYjcQT/the-problem-with-person-affecting-views
actions aren't good or bad for *anyone* until you've solicited the input of that someone!

you might *think* an action such as giving someone money will always be good for them but think about the case of "don't tempt me frodo". as difficult as it might be to imagine the possibility, someone might consider it *harmful* to even be *presented* with an offer of money.
or more grounded: a recovering drug addict who is in a program they chose that takes care of all their needs, but any "extra" money will merely tempt them to relapse.

the lexicographic ordering concept neatly sidesteps:
> Neutrality Principle: Adding an extra person to the world, if it is done in such a way as to leave the well-being levels of others unaffected, does not make a state of affairs either better or worse.

we *do* consider it better to create new beings, but only *after* present-being subject-blind democracy

**function-comparing ethics** is less assumptive than all forms of **person-comparing ethics** because function-comparing only compares beings to themselves, even better only compares *valuations* of beings from themselves

maybe: two functions with the same subject-blindness can be better if one of them encourages creating more people *unless creating those people would violate subject-blindness*. this is even stronger than


*linear* rankability isn't necessary to prioritize one thing over another, because lexicographic orderings can restrict themselves to only comparing like types *and* still prioritize some *types* over another.
but even then you can only linearly rank things in the same type

https://www.cold-takes.com/future-proof-ethics/


- type-theoretical rather than numerical models of beings (makes fewer assumptions)
- vectors of beings rather than mere "sums" across beings
- lexicographic orderings rather than mere linear orderings

> In theory, any harm can be outweighed by something that benefits a large enough number of persons, even if it benefits them in a minor way.

only if that person had equal weight to consider their output!

instead of weighing the *inherent* morality of giving a million people a bednet, we simply ask "do those million people *want* a bednet? how much compared to other things?"

you could spend a bunch of money giving people bednets. or you could donate that money to build a cooperative governed by the people for them to use to build whatever arbitrary public goods they value most.

https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iupkbiubpzDDGRpka/other-centered-ethics-and-harsanyi-s-aggregation-theorem
the snuck assumption in Harsanyi's Aggregation Theorem is that you can aggregate welfares of different people. you can aggregate their *solicited preferences*, but only through a voting system, so the only mechanism that could possibly *achieve* HAT is something like persistent democracy


with welfare types like these, how do we go about "adding" them together? the very act of adding them together assumes they have types for which an operation has been defined for them that has all the properties of addition (is abelian, etc)

```v
Inductive A :=
  | red
  | yellow
  | blue
.

Inductive B :=
  | mountain
  | forest
.
```

however it *is* reasonable to assume each being has an *internal* and *opaque* function they could use to assign value to different welfare outcomes at different timesteps.

the important thing is that we can recover all the reasonable and consistent conclusions of utilitarianism without the repugnant conclusions.

when comparing vectors we do this:

- align all beings with themselves. we can compare that being's valuation to itself, so we can say whether their valuation went up or down
- find all the beings that are added (born)
- find all the beings that are removed (die)

```v
Inductive Difference :=
  | DifferenceSelf (valuation_difference: integer)
  | DifferenceBirth (born_id: person_id)
  | DifferenceDeath (died_id: person_id)
.

Fixpoint ComputeDifference (A B: BeingsVector): Difference :=
  (* ... *)
.
```

we can see the last two things are entirely different types from the first. there isn't a non-axiomatic way we can compare a birth to a death to a change in welfare.

it could be reasonable in some situations to make more assumptions to have a "rough and ready" model for helping people. but that model must continue to respect subject-blindness to be consistent with this system.
