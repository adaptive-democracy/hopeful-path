# Persistent Democracy

The way to fix...<br>everything?

---

# structure of this talk

- very in depth
- broken into skippable chapters
- geared toward Effective Altruists, but not exclusively
- inspired by Glen Weyl and RxC, some review
- ordered for ease of understanding by a newcomer
- cycles between "big picture" and "nitty gritty"

---

# answers these questions

- why do we need Persistent Democracy?<br>
  *(most global problems are coordination problems)*
- what is Persistent Democracy, and how does it work?<br>
  *(continuous voting and efficient and flexible direct democracy)*
- how can we actually make it happen?<br>
  *(build tools, then persistently democratic parties and cooperatives)*
- why should Effective Altruists be especially interested?<br>
  *(research could be high impact)*<br>
  *(bootstrapping cooperatives could be massively scalable)*

# all are *coordination problems*

we could likely find solutions everyone finds *tolerable*

but the systems we use to make decisions are too clunky

- easily corrupted concentrations of power
- little incentive for consensus
- limited information input for citizens

---

# I'm convinced Persistent Democracy<br>can solve these problems

- make cooperation efficient, maybe provably optimally
- make **direct democracy** possible
- efficiently negotiate ownership of all resources
- allow cooperatives to finally live up to their full potential
- scale democratic society as big as communication and travel allow

---

# we have the *duty* of hope

we must *stubbornly insist*

we must ask *how* it is possible, not *if* it is possible

many relying on us: those already alive, and countless more in the future

# ðŸ“– coordination systems

<v-clicks>

big problems...

require powerful tools

</v-clicks>

---

# cooperation is humanity's superpower

- modern prosperity is rooted in cooperation
- sharing and passing down knowledge is a form of cooperation
- even small groups rely on cooperation to survive and thrive

<!-- cooperation is humanity's superpower, our logical systems are foundational tools, ones that help us achieve all our other goals, and that can cause all our other problems. improving our logical systems for coordination allows us to improve everything else about society. persistent democracy is my best bet at a (possibly provably) best base system for democratic coordination -->

## we use logical systems to cooperate at scale

can't find consensus socially with too many people

![](/drawing-1-noise.png)

## we can use logical systems to cooperate at scale

# voting systems can be<br>*studied mathematically*

- it's possible to *prove* things about voting systems
- some can be provably *better than others*
- some can even be provably *optimal*

# logic is of course only the first step

we have to validate our ideas in the real world

but we shouldn't neglect logical analysis!

logic can help us avoid obvious mistakes and costly failed experiments

# ranked choice?

seems better at first...

- still has spoiler effect
- lots of other weird pathologies
  - winner = loser paradox
  - drop out reversal paradox
  - violates later-no-harm criterion
- generally subtle and confusing and surprising

## ranked choice measures the wrong thing

elections aren't "tournaments of gladiators"

want choices that produce the most satisfaction or happiness for the group

we should use a system that *directly measures satisfaction*

## why square root?

has to do with "linear cost curves"

![](/linear-cost-curves.png)

## imagine a voting tug-of-war

<!-- imagine there's a town where they've already used voting weights to decide the status quo -->

<!-- assume this town has already settled into an equilibrium where everyone is satisfied enough with their allocation that they won't change it -->

<!-- imagine this as a big tug of war where everyone is pulling on everyone else -->

<v-click>

roughly `nÂ²` possible relationships between `n` people

<!-- then a new person shows up! by definition whenever they allocate weights, they're pulling vote results away from what everyone else in the town wanted -->
<!-- the harder you pull, the more it is an unwanted disturbance to the other voters -->
<!-- if you count the number of possible relationships between all the people in this town, with `n` people it will be: -->

## pulling harder causes "pain" of roughly `nÂ²`

`(n * (n - 1)) / 2` to be exact

quadratic voting "compensates" everyone else for your vote

# ðŸ“– rights and constitutions

# ðŸ“– quadratic range voting

can we combine the strengths of score and resource voting systems?

---
layout: statement
---

## score voting systems are great at *measuring preference alignment*

## resource voting systems are great at *measuring preference strength*

---

# score voting systems

great at signaling *preference alignment*

- can be arbitrarily accurate (rational numbers less than 1)
- maxing out score indicates an option as being the best case scenario

great for choosing between options that can *possibly be equivalent*

*(equivalent options never compete with or dilute each other)*

<!-- (if scores are given as rational numbers composed of infinite integers, which all must be less than 1) -->
<!-- (given strategic concerns) -->
<!-- (how a choice aligns with someone's best/worst case expectations) -->

---

# score voting systems

*not* great at:

- preventing dishonest "min/max" scores
- measuring the absolute strength of a maxed out score

---

# resource voting systems

great at signaling *preference strength*

- can be arbitrarily accurate (rational numbers which sum to less than 1)
- prevents arbitrary strategic dishonesty

great for choosing between options that are *unlikely to be equivalent*

*(choosing between incomparable or "apples and oranges" things)*

<!-- (how much someone cares about a choice compared to others) -->
<!-- (if allocations are given as rational numbers composed of infinite integers, which all must sum to less than 1) -->

<!-- a big part of the reason quadratic voting is so useful is it compensates for this kind of accuracy dilution by making splitting resources less truly costly -->

---

# resource voting systems

*not* great at:

- allowing people to signal with complete accuracy how much they *like* some concrete choice
- preventing possibly equivalent options diluting each other

---

# resource and score are *complementary*

- resource voting for inherently incomparable *abstract* options
- score voting for possibly equivalent or comparable *concrete* options

---

# resource and score are *complementary*

- resource voting for relative concern about *elections*
- score voting for alignment with *candidates* in elections

---

# quadratic range voting

- if you approve of some candidates, use weights to place a *positive* ballot
- if you disapprove of others, use *separate* weights to place a *negative* ballot
- number of weights multiplies scores

---

## quadratic range voting

![](/drawing-quadratic-range-voting.png)

---

# who gets on the ballot?

with resource voting, we don't *need* nomination

costs weights to support a candidate

---

# still important to limit *noise*

without nomination, possible to flood elections with nonsense candidates

how do voters know which to investigate further?

<v-clicks>

candidates could only get attention with marketing or outreach

**which inherently favors those with such resources**

</v-clicks>

---

# nomination system

- useful candidates gain visibility with an initial push from a group of focused and passionate supporters
- voters would only have to look at their ballots to know who they should look more seriously into

useful candidates can *gradually* gain attention

with genuine traction, can present candidate for general consideration

---
class: dense
---

# nomination buckets

- new candidates must fill a *nomination bucket*
- bucket fills up faster if nominators have placed more weights
- bucket gets larger (or fills less quickly?) in correspondence with:
  - voters in the total electorate increasing?
  - voters actually participating in the election increasing
  - already nominated candidates increasing
  - nominees increasing

change the below analogy to choosing where to go eat as a group of friends. your feelings about different restaurants exists in a complex multi-dimensional space, where each option might be good for different things as different times (after you've exercised, when on a date, with your family, etc). but since we've narrowed the specificity of the choice it's possible to score the options on a single scale, "how enjoyable is this place to go with friends".

however if we say "you can either choose where we go as friends or where you go with your family tomorrow", suddenly these choices don't exist on the same simple scale, or if they do the scale is much more general such as "how much do you care about this thing". you might be much more sensitive to your choice of restaurant when with your family than with your friends
perhaps its possible to say we could use scoring system all the time, but we have to introduce resource voting *somewhere* to overcome the strategic problems with score voting.

perhaps its as simple as the fact that similar options for the same choice can cannibalize each other in unproductive ways. it is *theoretically* possible to have both choice concern and option alignment use score voting, but then the entire system is strategically unsound
the problem with comparable choice cannibalization is that if you score two things the same then you really just consider them equivalent and would prefer them to be merged into one choice. that's less realistic with incomparable choices, the two can't be "the same", and if that's really the case then you should *really* be voting at the constitutional level *above* these choices in order to rearrange them into a more logical shape


if I asked you to describe to me how much you like different ice cream flavors, what's the most natural way to most accurately describe your feelings? (say we're going to get ice cream as a group, and for constraints out of our control we can only get one flavor. when making this specific choice one really can score each choice on a scale of "how much happiness" you expect to get from that option, and options can vary widely, including being tied)
it's obviously by giving them all a score, with the scale being "degree of enjoyment".

- the scale goes negative
- the scale is *theoretically* unbounded, even once you get to transcendent ecstasy you can theoretically go further, but in practice most things fall into a normal range.
- different choices can be pretty far apart from each other

a simple ranking would pretty obviously do a bad job allowing you to describe your preferences. if you were describing your preferences informally and I forced you to use a ranking, you would almost certainly include a lot of "scoring context" so I actually understood what you mean

but what if I mixed in different car models?

different experiences are obviously different, eating ice cream is different, and incomparable, to riding in a car


if you're trying to choose between a series of concrete outcomes for the same choice, the only way to signal your feelings with arbitrary accuracy is with a scoring system. the outer limits of the scoring range represent the absolutely best/worst case emotional outcomes.
the reason this is true is because if you use a resource system you might have to split resources between nearly equivalent options. since options can actually possibly be equivalent, making you split resources between them would cause dilution of accuracy.

but the important question here is: how do we determine how extreme those outer limits are? for people who aren't effected by/don't care about some decision, the outer limits are very low, and the opposite is true.

| Non-Rivalrous | **Club goods**<br>cinemas, private parks, satellite television, public transport | **Public goods**<br>free-to-air television, air, national defense, free and open-source software |

# classic definition is controversial

nothing is truly *non*-excludable, just impractically expensive to exclude

rivalry/exclusion are continuous dimensions rather than simple categories

# cooperative goods

happen when people combine contributions into a single good and share its benefits

individually their contributions would be worthless

tend to have "thresholds" of usefulness

# swimming pools

- easy to share
- cost can be divided many ways

## most public goods are also cooperative goods:
<!-- in the sense that they *have* to be shared in order to be worth the cost -->

- municipal water systems
- public parks
- community defense
- environmental protection

---

## many public goods are *only* valuable when shared

- roads
- internet networks
- languages

---

## some *can't* be made into club goods:
<!-- because exclusion can't possibly be done by anything other than a government with a military -->

- national parks
- environmental protection

<!-- because there's inherent moral or societal value in giving everyone access -->

- roads
- public education

# startup capital disadvantage

<v-clicks>

- wouldn't be a problem in a society with effective public goods systems
- if most capital is held by profit seekers, most capital will be deployed for profit seeking
- fine once operating at scale

</v-clicks>

<!--
cooperatives only have one big disadvantage, and only in an inefficiently profit-focused economy like ours: comparative difficulty raising *startup* capital. once a cooperative is operating at scale it can much more plausibly fund initiatives with saved capital from members or even through debt financing. but when it's very small that isn't as true.
in an economy/society like ours where profit-seekers control almost all of the capital and only wish to deploy that capital to seek further profits (rather than creating true market value in the form of consumer surplus or prosperity or progress) it will be difficult to get some of that capital to create cooperatives that could out-compete profit-seeking companies.
it seems fairly obvious to me this isn't an *inherent* structural disadvantage of the cooperative model, but one that only exists in societies like ours that don't properly tax property and don't properly provision public goods. in a society that properly provisions public goods and prevents property-based wealth ratchet, there will be lots of capital in public hands ready to use to create new startup cooperatives, for example using something like persistent funding.

surveillance and recommender systems. the social problems created by large tech firms, especially those related to media and information, have become pressing and obvious. many people discuss how to solve these problems by somehow reforming the companies or regulations, but I think the *real* solution to these problems is quite obvious, cooperative ownership. the real problem at the heart of problematic companies of all kinds (not only tech companies) is the incentives of the companies aren't aligned with those of their customers or society at large. cooperative ownership directly solves the problem of alignment with customers (since they are the owning decision-makers), and obliquely solves the problem of alignment with society since membership in a cooperative is open.

# ðŸ“– persistent democracy and Effective Altruism

most big problems require big coordination

---

## persistent democracy as a force multiplier

- comparable to other "meta" efforts in terms of expected impact
- better coordination systems help solve every other problem
- democratic ethics are very compatible with EA
- bootstrapping cooperatives should receive EA funding

---

## better coordination systems help solve every other problem

- global health and development (improve governance and coordination)
- climate change, biosecurity and pandemic prevention, nuclear security (global coordination and new public goods)
- space governance (persistent constitutions and common resource rights)

<v-click>

- AI alignment
  - superhuman AI precipice (improve governance and deliberation)
  - **automation precipice**

</v-click>

<!--  
it's pretty obvious most global health and development problems are really just examples of coordination failure and resource inequality, and it should be pretty obvious the only truly robust and scalable solutions to those problems are ones that allow the effected people to coordinate to solve the problems themselves.

pretty obvious relationship, these all require global coordination and new public goods

persistent constitutions and common resource rights could very plausibly govern a global or multi-planet society. the fluidity of these systems would make it quite straightforward to decide how to divide space resources, either by placing them into shared public governance as is done with things like national parks, or simply using markets driven by common resource rights to fluidly decide ownership.

## automation precipice

- even weak AI could still render most people economically useless and militarily powerless
- concentration of this power in too few hands could cause many problems
- ethically precarious for many reasons

<v-click>

- persistent democracy could plausibly cooperativize ownership of AI systems
- could ensure benefits are widely shared

## cooperative bootstrapping should receive EA funding

- grants for research and infrastructure
- low or zero interest loans for scaling
- scaled cooperatives are self-sustaining

cooperative bootstrapping is a massively scalable project

<!-- 
cooperatives have the potential to indirectly solve many other societal problems. wealth inequality and corporate misalignment have many knock-on effects in terms of how they negatively impact culture and deliberation and values and global health. for example, a facet of problems like obesity is the fact food manufacturers have misaligned incentives.

this is where EA organizations (or any altruistic organizations) have the opportunity to step in. if we can get a critical mass of cooperatives to the point where they're operating at scale, then we can be fairly confident they can take it from there. this means grants or low or zero interest loans to scaling cooperatives is a very good impact investment
in general I think persistent democracy is a very convincing EA initiative. EA has generally centered around utilitarian ethics and a desire to maximize welfare, and I can think of few better ways to do so than to improve coordination efficiency in a way that allows any person to fairly express their preferences.
I have much more specific theoretical claims about the possible welfare optimality of persistent democracy, and I'll make those in my next talk. I think there's a strong chance persistent democracy is optimal

# ðŸ“– I need help!

feedback, funding, allies

---

## I'm an engineer, not a leader or a manager

I want to build things like Magmide, and other exciting engineering work

[![magmide talk](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Lf7ML_ErWvQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7ML_ErWvQ)

I'd love to do so in the context of a "startup-energy" cooperatives

# immediate needs

- legal advisors (formation of organizations)
- academics (do fundamental research)
- software engineers (help build software tools)
- communicators (improve my explanations)
- funding for all the above
