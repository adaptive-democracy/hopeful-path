first general intuitive overview of persistent democracy
persistent weights
persistent voting
update schedule
stabilization
briefly nomination buckets

why?
solves deadline problems
elections/discovery are unified
achieves the same benefits of consent/Sociocracy
hysteresis

persistent commitments could allow pushing the decision deadline back, based on
a candidate/document could have commitments *attached* that need to be "fulfilled" or something by a cyclical commitment before they actually take place

with no deadline problems it's reasonable to allow direct document election, even at *root*
this bakes the
makes non-participation unproblematic
has benefits of resource voting, especially if there are diverse decisions to be made
allows arbitrary responsiveness


resource-scaled score voting gets benefits of both, gracefully degrades to mere score voting when there are few decisions



high-level thoughts about theory
describe universe, beings, welfare, coordination function system
the simplest model is of agents in an instantaneous auction for a "universe of property" using a democratic currency (such as weights)
if the welfare value of all property is maximized, we've achieved a "subject-blind" or "ethical"
this simple auction would maximize welfare value of all property (satisfies fundamental axioms of welfare economics, and even more such as envy-freedom)

however a real universe can be much more complicated than a simple auction:
- beings are *made up of* the same stuff property is (beings are *inside* the universe)
- nonzero coordination costs
- nonzero switching costs

need mechanisms to address these:
- beings need to be delineated from everything else (we use systems of human rights for this)
- can't be instantaneous
- should be stabilized somehow (switching should have to be justified)

- *Coordination costs*
- *Switching costs*
- *Reversal costs*

the most problematic is reversal costs, since that *could* mean some actions must merely be *categorically prohibited*

the only way to achieve this level of flexibility is by treating the universe as an opaque vector of unknown things, and the coordination function has to have arbitrary computational capabilities
if the coordination function is authored in type theory it is capable of anything logic/mathematics are capable of

some hand-waving about function/model composition, optimality of persistent voting for an arbitrary function

in a way we've just "kicked the can down the road" by shoving all the *real* decision-making responsibility down into this function
but it seems *possible* to prove this is optimal for any universe/beings
