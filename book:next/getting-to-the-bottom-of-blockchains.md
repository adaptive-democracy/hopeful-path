we don't really need many of the kinds of decentralization people are playing around with right now

if you aren't doing cutting edge research in computational cryptography, distributed systems, or economics, then you aren't really doing useful work to forward blockchains. the best you can do is create buzz. the only notable exceptions are systems that are attempt to encode real *computational* scarcity (only computational because its the only kind of scarcity that can be verified by these networks without outside organizations) and therefore create a perfectly fluid decentralized market for a real good or service. so protocols that encode useful storage or computational capacity to the network are already completely useful, such as filecoin or dfinity, etc. very importantly, since only protocols that encode *real* scarcity will ultimately survive, this means *these protocols will do nothing to qualitatively reverse wealth inequality or centralized control*. real wealth and power comes from ownership and control of truly scarce resources, so if these protocols merely encode real scarcity, existing holders of vast resources will remain the most powerful actors in new systems. these protocols will merely make markets more efficient, not reverse the rights abuses that created the status quo. mere markets are not the same thing as true democracy
decentralized protocols aren't going to give small actors access to [rack-scale or even data-center scale hardware design](https://oxide.computer/), so although they won't be entirely locked out of the compute market, they'll still be massively outmatched by centralized players in the large number of non-niche computing cases.

decentralized *identity* is the most important unsolved problem.

importantly, NFTs aren't the thing that will change how we think about property. without enforcement, a deed of ownership is completely useless. if we want to revolutionize our understanding of property, we have to do so at the governmental level. however, blockchains can be invaluable in giving our governments a secure and transparent computational foundation.


the only systems that really have immediate utility are filecoin and other systems that are rooted in *real* scarcity.

tokenomics as an idea has been dramatically over-applied. if a currency doesn't stably maintain a rough inflation rate, then it isn't actually valuable as a currency. if a token is ostensibly a "utility token" but its price isn't inexorably tied to the real scarcity limiting the underlying work then it's irrational and will be out-competed by something else

there's a theoretical limit of these kinds of semi-cooperative decentralized ledgers, which is one that has zero (marginal) transaction costs, changes state fast enough to be below the threshold of human perception, and is only limited by real computational scarcity. however such a system would completely nullify the two primary incentive systems in the blockchain space (artificially scarce coins that will speculatively rise in value, transaction fees). however such a system *is* possible if the network has a model of "mutual obligation" where each person-linked account is simply expected to do work to secure and audit the ledger, and is exiled if it doesn't meet its obligations or commits fraud. the only way to pay for the development of such a system is with public goods funding, since by its very design it doesn't allow any other funding models. and again, that design achieves a theoretical limit of usefulness! so if we *have* a way of provisioning public goods enough to fund such a thing, then it will inevitably replace and outstrip other models


fiat currencies are useful *because* they are fiat currencies, their value as a social technology is entirely defined by these two qualities:

- they maintain a roughly stable inflation, *therefore* roughly encoding the real scarcity of available labor and resources in the underlying economy
- they are enforced as a legal tender, removing all the deadweight loss from all the coordination costs necessary in secondary currency market. standardization and unification are useful!


If a monetary system has any stable, non negative inflation rate then it will rationally track any economy, possibly even if its shrinking?





the only real difference between a DAO and a democratic member cooperative is that a DAO makes all decisions on a blockchain. a normal institution can automate governance in the exact same way by using computable legal code, so there's nothing inherently different about that. and crypto bros are fooling themselves if they think a DAO can escape the need for actual humans to follow its decisions when they need to be translated to reality.
then the only thing I really want to bring about is an identity-based blockchain that operates through mutual obligation rather than speculative finance incentives, recentering labor rather than assets.

in a mutual obligation network????

- if you create more computational or storage work, you don't necessarily have to *pay* for all that on the network, but you do have to pay for it in your local version and you are the one expected to validate others are replicating it properly.
- or your obligation to others increases. this is ultimately just like a currency?? except that this network obligation can't be transferred?
- oh oh or we simply use democratic weights to allocate obligation at any one time! rather than burning currency we simply prioritize work according to a democratic weighting. if it's possible for an actor or group to do more computation upfront on their own and therefore decrease the amount of work necessary by the network then we can still let people spend physical resources in order to make more complex things happen faster

it's the same as any cooperative good: in order to be a part of the cooperative, you have to provide the same amount of utility to the cooperative, and you get access to the benefits as a cooperative as a result. you have the same right to cooperative goods as everyone else as represented by your democratic weights, and at

all property is backed up by enforcement

utility tokens don't make any sense
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12525-020-00412-9

something only has *true* value if the value is intrinsic and robust to adversarialism, only if it encodes true scarcity in a way that will actually be honored.

a protocol that requires users to pay for potentially artificially scarce utility tokens in order to use the "service" will always be outcompeted in the limit by a merely open source system that only requires users to pay for whatever real network resources are required to run it



human value is nothing other than (is defined as)
the experience of welfare (or utility)
enabled by access to scarce resources
facilitated by labor

the short version: resources facilitated by labor

things are only valuable to the degree they somehow point downward at these basic concepts

stocks for example are only valuable because they entitle the holder to shares of future profits (and votes regarding those profits and the right to sell the share), and those profits can be used to trade for resources or labor that produce welfare

do we really need blockchains? are compute cooperatives good enough?
is an identity membership chain good enough?
can we just store nothing but current membership and standing and seal snapshots/hashes and nothing else?

daos don't uniquely enable anything other than cryptographic transparency of code operation
democratic cooperative ownership principles are the thing that enables actual freedom

daos don't solve the value attribution problem, arguably the most important and valuable unsolved problem for humanity. it will likely end up being some messy blend of an algorithm and mere democracy
