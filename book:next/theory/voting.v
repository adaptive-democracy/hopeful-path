It seems that the perfectly optimal system would be the omniscient mediator
basically a system capable of communicating with us instantly, who knows our welfare wishes perfectly and knows exactly what we're about to do, and whenever we're about to do something that will interfere with another person it warns us, helps us instantly negotiate with that person to find actions for the both of us that best preserve our welfare intent while minimally interfering with one another.
this thing doesn't even necessarily have to have perfect knowledge of our internal state, but we can use some sort of weighted vote system to protect certain areas of concern and choose to move them around at this instantaneous level
this is getting at the fact that the *entire* medium of interaction between welfare-concerned beings is the universe. this means that negotiating for usage capability of different spaces of the universe is the *only* way we need to negotiate with one another. negotiating over actions is really just negotating over *contextualized* actions in relation to the current state of all concerned beings

such a system obviously doesn't exist, probably won't ever exist, even if it could many of us generally dislike the idea of being so closely watched so the very presence of that system would harm our welfare.

so instead we create systems of rights, which are basically a way to *durably* encode space-usage negotiations with a minimum of coordination cost. we negotiate over the *general* structure of these rights systems in our constitutions, and this negotiation represents our best guesses at what kinds of votes we would cast in different kinds of negotiations. for example a society that agrees no one should be able to demand non-interfering actions from others would encode ownership of body, etc.

we also can create rules for more dynamic negotations, ones where we don't think we can make broad rules. for example a system like common resource taxes on land encodes a negotiation algorithm for all physical spaces that all members of the group can use to dynamically adjust ownership according to highest valuation.








unified theory of human cooperation, coordination plans, coordinated vs uncoordinated action

It seems useful to generalize the kind of groups we're interested in creating with a simple name: a democratic group.




If qualia types are in fact distinct, then comparing the qualia of two different people is simply an undefined operation, in the same way it's undefined to divide by zero or take the square root of green
So a potentially more consistent set of utility axioms could be simply that a universe is only more or less morally valuable in relation to itself
So the moral valuation function first measures the degree to which each agent is best able to maximize their valuation at each time step, and then only after that is considered can it consider whether more or less agents exist.
This seems to nicely handle the problem of population ethics since it means you can't just arbitrarily create functions the prioritize some happy lives over others or larger groups of somewhat happy lives over a smaller number of happier lives, since that would likely require violating the functions ability to allow existing beings to maximize their value. The valuation happens at the level of the coordination function not the vector of lives
It seems that function can be simply valued according to its degree of fit with the perfect omniscient democratic function, which is practically impossible for us to achieve
Except that you don't need perfect coordination if you can instead simply assign each agent an equally large or equally valued realm of choice that can't rivalrously interfere with others
Time-stepped coordination functions and omniscient democracy: avoiding the contradictions and confusions of population ethics with a type theoretical blend of utilitarian and deontological reasoning.





theory of wealth, welfare, and progress, two "lever" arrangements (`wealth = available_resources * labor * technological_leverage`)

- not sure if these equations actually make sense. the lever analogy makes sense, but what this really means is that wealth is something equivalent to "moved resources", in the physics sense of "work performed = mass * distance". so prosperity is really a *measure* of how much effort it takes to move one "unit" of welfare, so this is inherently "relative" in the sense that it is computed from the frame of each actor in the system. it might take very little effort to move a unit of welfare for one person, but that might represent an externalization of effort to someone else in an extractive manner. leverage in both these cases then isn't really a "quantity", but a description of the ratio of effort required to move the same unit. the lever itself defines that ratio. leverage in this situation is kind of like we're moving resources into a configuration that *replaces* labor.
- `potential_prosperity = potential_moved_welfare = wealth_leverage * welfare_leverage * potential_labor`
- `potential_wealth = available_resources * (technological_leverage * potential_labor)`
- `wealth = moved_resources = technological_leverage * expended_labor`
- `prosperity = wealth * welfare_leverage`
- this theory of wealth and progress is inherently *step-indexed*, much like a computer program. the leverage power of the previous step's arrangement of matter effects how much we can achieve in this step. also probably important to add some "decay" function to each step, to represent the concept that some things require maintenance. also "waste" or "entropy" functions to encode carbon emissions and heat and unusable byproducts. in the step-indexed view, *current* potential wealth is the total amount of resources you could move based on current leverage, labor power, and available resources, and potential prosperity is the amount of welfare you could produce based on welfare leverage and wealth. so there's a raw resource leverage coefficient and a welfare leverage coefficient associated with any current resource arrangement. a simple analogy for a system like this is a 3d grid space with two possible welfare uses and materials for a raw lever, and the functions assign leverage numbers based on current position/orientation of the lever
