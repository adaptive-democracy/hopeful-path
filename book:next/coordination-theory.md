unified theory of human cooperation, coordination plans, coordinated vs uncoordinated action

It seems useful to generalize the kind of groups we're interested in creating with a simple name: a democratic group.




If qualia types are in fact distinct, then comparing the qualia of two different people is simply an undefined operation, in the same way it's undefined to divide by zero or take the square root of green
So a potentially more consistent set of utility axioms could be simply that a universe is only more or less morally valuable in relation to itself
So the moral valuation function first measures the degree to which each agent is best able to maximize their valuation at each time step, and then only after that is considered can it consider whether more or less agents exist.
This seems to nicely handle the problem of population ethics since it means you can't just arbitrarily create functions the prioritize some happy lives over others or larger groups of somewhat happy lives over a smaller number of happier lives, since that would likely require violating the functions ability to allow existing beings to maximize their value. The valuation happens at the level of the coordination function not the vector of lives
It seems that function can be simply valued according to its degree of fit with the perfect omniscient democratic function, which is practically impossible for us to achieve
Except that you don't need perfect coordination if you can instead simply assign each agent an equally large or equally valued realm of choice that can't rivalrously interfere with others
Time-stepped coordination functions and omniscient democracy: avoiding the contradictions and confusions of population ethics with a type theoretical blend of utilitarian and deontological reasoning.
