# Persistent Democracy

The purpose of Persistent Democracy is to create a system of group decision making that is the most expressive, flexible, and accurate it could possibly be. To do this, Persistent Democracy uses one core idea: every person in a cooperative group has some arbitrary number of "decision weights" they use for voting:

- Each person can move their weights around at any time, rather than having to wait for an election event to come and go.
- Each person can move around different amounts of these weights to effect the outcome of different decisions, so they can put more on decisions they care more about.
- Weights can be used as a negative vote, meaning you can vote *against* something.
- Weights are "moved" rather than "spent", so using weights to influence decisions doesn't change how many weights you have.
- The exact number of weights each person has doesn't matter, since weights can be split up by placing a decimal quantity such as `0.5` on a decision.
- In an equal democracy, each person has the same number of weights and so has the same amount of decision power. It might make sense for private organizations to use structures where different members have different numbers of weights.

The basic idea of giving each person a number of decision weights that can be moved around at any time is the only assumption of Persistent Democracy.

However, there are many different ways for these weights to actually *effect* decisions, and different ways are better for making different kinds of decisions! We could design any system to use weights to make any kind of decision, but there are three important ones we want to talk about now:

- Persistent Voting for making decisions that are reversible.
- Persistent Commitments for making decisions that require some sacrifice and so aren't reversible.
- Persistent Funding that combines Quadratic Funding with democratic weights to prioritize and fund projects.

## Persistent Voting

There are many decisions we would call "reversible", meaning we can change our minds and make a different decision at any time. Basically all our elections for public servants such as mayors, police chiefs, sanitation commissioners, etc, are all reversible decisions. These people are just employees of our shared governance bodies, and in the same way we allow private companies to replace their employees at basically any time, we should be able to replace our public servants at any time. Persistent Voting just changes a decision to be ongoing rather than happening in a single irreversible event, so we still have to choose some "inner" voting method that's used to actually add up votes. Possible options include pure [Quadratic Voting](TODO), some variant of it like [Quadratic Range Voting](TODO), or any other voting method that takes different amounts of weights into account.

However it would be inefficient and chaotic to allow changes to be made *too* quickly (it wouldn't be great for the mayor to change four times in a hour). So we should design some stabilization method that keeps the current winner from switching too quickly. You can find the precise details of the stabilization method we've designed in [the theory section](TODO), but generally we've taken some inspiration from [Conviction Voting](TODO) to design a method that follows these principles:

- If a new candidate pulls ahead of the current winner, they begin to fill up some "stabilization bucket". If they fill up the entire bucket they become the new current winner of the position.
- If the new candidate has a bigger vote advantage they fill up the stabilization bucket faster.
- If the new candidate loses their vote advantage, the stabilization bucket begins to drain based on the size of the new gap.

We'll talk about how the size of these stabilization buckets is determined in a later section. In general we want more important decisions that effect more people to have bigger stabilization buckets and therefore need more weight to change.

It also wouldn't be great for the vote differences to be published instantly, since it would be annoying and stressful for people to worry about what vote changes might be happening at all different hours. For this reason we should choose some sort of "update rhythm", basically the times and days where the current state of all votes is actually tabulated and published. This would allow each member to only worry about their votes at most one time in every update cycle.

Persistent voting is exciting because it allows true direct democracy to be efficient and stable. Since voters can change their vote in any election at any time, they can participate in only the decisions they're actually concerned about while leaving other decisions for other voters. Many more decisions could be made democratically without overwhelming everyone.

It even allows "auto-pilot democracy", where low voter turnout is essentially a nonissue. If some concerned minority makes most of the electoral choices, and everyone else is perfectly fine with those choices, then the majority can just not participate without worry. If the concerned minority begins making harmful or foolish choices, the rest of society can quickly override them before harm is done.

It's even possible to delegate power to elected officials by simply giving them some number of extra persistent weights that can only be used for specific types of decisions. This means a group can keep their ability to effect those decisions directly, but still delegate decision making power to someone with the expertise and time to deeply understand those decisions. This means specific decisions that have enough democratic energy can happen without having to wait for the elected official, and decisions that are more tricky or difficult to understand can be left to the officials while still giving the group the ability to override the officials without simply removing them.

Persistent voting can even be used to select *documents*, such as constitutions, tax codes, legal definitions, or anything else. These elections work the same way as those for officials, where voters nominate documents and whichever document has the current greatest amount of support is the one that's in effect.

We [theorize](TODO) that persistent voting will have many massive benefits:

- Allows groups to more quickly discover new options and converge toward decisions that are better for everyone.
- Removes regretful strategic voting or "election hangovers", since negative surprises can just be counteracted before they do harm.
- Positive surprises are also much more possible, since their possibility can be detected and reinforced more easily.
- Makes it way more expensive to "buy" an election with media blitzes or fake stories.
- Elections would be less sensitive to noise, politicking, campaigning, and predictions about the outcome.
- Would allow more complex voting methods, since voters have unlimited time to think about and understand how they wish to vote.

## Persistent Commitments

Not all decisions are reversible! Many of the most consequential decisions we make, such as all those that spend resources, are irreversible.

Persistent Democracy can still be used to make irreversible decisions, it just has to do so more carefully. The whole point of persistent voting is that it removes election deadlines, which are dangerous because they create sensitive "strategic windows" where bad actors can stir up noise and skew results. With true commitments we can't avoid some sort of deadlines, but we can mitigate them by leaning all the way into the principles of [conviction voting](TODO). Here's how a persistent commitment works, visit the [theory page](TODO) for the exact details:

- Each commitment has a deadline. Some commitments are cyclical such as those for budget periods, but other commitments might only happen once.
- During the voting period before the deadline, voters can move around their weights to nominate and vote for "decision documents" that say what should be done in the commitment. For example a budget commitment would choose the budget document.
- However instead of using stabilization buckets and a current winner as is done in persistent voting, particular choices instead *accumulate* votes as the deadline approaches.
- If a voter has kept some weights on the same option for longer then their weights are stronger.
- If a voter removes weights from an option, the weight moves slowly from the old to the new instead of happening immediately.
- When the deadline hits, whichever option is the winner is chosen.

This process is designed to reward durable and consistent voting, and to prevent weird strategic swings or surprises right before the deadline. Since commitments have to be made more carefully we want to err on the side of choices that are better understood, even possibly choosing to "do nothing"!

In most types of commitments, options only accumulate weight *during* the cycle itself. But in cycles like those used in persistent funding, options can accumulate weight over their entire life until they're chosen and funded.

## Persistent Funding

You've probably encountered the idea of donation matching, when some large donor promises to match donations made by other people for some cause. The reason matching is useful is because it gives large donors a way to figure out the best places to donate money by just donating to whatever other people think is important enough to donate to.

However simple matching systems like one-to-one or other ideas give a lot of power to other large donors, and don't have any basis in rigorous logic. [Quadratic Funding](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-funding/) solves that and many other problems. I'll just quote the explanation given in that linked page:

> Quadratic Funding optimizes matching funds by prioritizing projects based on the number of people who contributed. This way, funds meant to benefit the public go towards projects that really benefit a broad public, instead of things that only have a few wealthy backers. ... Quadratic Funding strongly encourages people to make contributions, no matter how small, and ensures a democratic allocation of funds meant to benefit the public.

Quadratic Funding has been mathematically proven to match funds in a way that will maximize the shared public good created by donations. The short way to explain it is that it gives more matching money to projects with many small donors than those with a few large donors. If you want to get deeper into the math behind the system, [read this post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html).

The biggest problem with Quadratic Funding is that it demands really high amounts of matching funds to work as promised. Since the amount of donations coming in will almost always demand more matching funds than are actually available, we either have to not give projects the full optimal funding specified by the system, or we have to have a way to decide which projects to fund first. We can figure out this ordering, and solve some other issues, by using persistent weights to prioritize projects in a cycle of persistent commitments.

Let's say a cooperating group sets aside some percentage of their recurring budget to a quadratic funding pool. This means at any time the pool has some amount of money, and regularly receives more from the budget. We want a system to decide how this money should be used for quadratic matching that isn't arbitrary and gives projects the full optimal amount. We would also like to avoid funding scammy nuisance projects, or projects that aren't relevant to the cooperating group.

Anyone can use their weights to either vote for or against some project, and by default the system can just fund the projects in order of the *ratio* of weights against how much matching money it would take to fund them. So if a project has lots of weight and wouldn't take very much public money to fund, that project is a better social investment than a project with less weight that would take a lot of public money to fund.

Funding also happens in a cycle of persistent commitments, so weights can be used to choose decision documents that do something more complicated than just funding projects in order. They could choose to guarantee the funding of large or urgent projects, add one-time lumpsums to the funding pool, remove nuisance projects, or even do nothing for that cycle. This system gives groups the chance to intervene in each cycle rather than blindly trust this simple formula.

## Constitutional Persistent Democracy

Any cooperative group should have some constitution that defines at the very top level what their rules are. Cooperation is [more transaparent and therefore more fair](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/contra-weyl-on-technocracy) when the rules are clearly written down.

The benefit of using persistent voting to select constitutions is that a cooperative group can structure their rules in any way they feel is convenient and useful, and then change them as soon as they want to. If a cooperative group feels they'd rather make fewer directly democratic decisions but instead delegate to elected officials, they can do that. If they realize they'd rather make certain decisions directly but delegate others, they can do that.

If these constitutions are written in a [computable governance code](TODO), then the constitutional document can even be used to automatically generate voting software or institutional servers. Doing this would be especially useful in private organizations.

Interestingly, groups could choose to create portions of their constitution *that can't be changed*, or that can only be changed with a more difficult persistent commitment. We call these portions "constitutional kernels", and they essentially make it impossible or very difficult to change those rules without throwing away the existing system and creating a new one.

To understand why you might do this, let's ask this question: if you have a constitution selected with persistent voting, should it be possible to change *the fact that the constitution is selected with persistent voting*? Doing so could potentially make it impossible to go back to what you had before. We're not sure if kernels would be a good idea for governments, but they could make sense for certain kinds of private organizations. Visit [the theory page](TODO) if you're interested in the fine details of questions like this.

Constitutions can contain other constitutions much in the way nesting dolls contain other nesting dolls. You can write a constitution that allows "sub-constitutions" to be created underneath it for more specific areas of decision making. Upper constitutions can limit the power of sub-constitutions, such as to enforce rights or limit jurisdiction. This fits really nicely with things like federated administration, since every level can divide up the area underneath it to delegate responsibility.

This nesting gives us a natural way to decide how big things like stabilization buckets should be. Decisions that effect more people should have larger stabilization buckets and so be more difficult to change. Oppositely, if a constitution allows more directly democratic decisions, then each individual decision should have a smaller stabilization bucket and so be easier to change, since the group is deciding that each person is effectively delegating more decisions to other people.

These rules lead to very intuitively reasonable situation, visit [the theory page](TODO) for more details:

- Decisions such as a top level constitution effect more people and are the only decision at their level, so they're more difficult to change.
- Lower level decisions involve fewer people and have more "sibling" decisions at their same level, to they're easier to change.

These constitutions would define what decisions are made with persistent voting or commitments or any other method. Visit [the page about miscellaneous methods](TODO) if you want more ideas for ways persistent weights could be used.

## Comparison with Liquid Democracy

Both persistent and [liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy) are really trying to achieve the same thing. Both want to make direct democracy possible by allowing every person to directly effect every group decision. Liquid democracy does this by allowing voters to delegate their votes to some other person, who can then delegate them again, and so on.

We feel this system doesn't offer any unique benefits that aren't also enjoyed by persistent democracy, and could fall victim to a pretty nasty problem: "lazy demagoguery". Liquid democracy would make it easy for a voter to just delegate huge amounts of their votes to someone they shallowly like such as a media personality, and never bother to check on what those votes are being used for. Those kinds of concentrations of voting power would be a problematic vulnerability, and are completely avoidable.

Persistent democracy just as powerfully supports delegation as liquid democracy, but in a simpler way: "delegation by abstention". If you don't care about an issue, or you aren't confident you actually know enough about it to have a useful opinion, just don't vote on it and allow others to make the decision. You can always change your mind and move your weights around, and the exact stabilization bucket system is designed to make more important decisions take longer to change, giving you more time to notice them if you actually do care.

No system can ever change the fact that people will listen to others and be swayed by their opinions, so no matter what there will be some amount of "delegation by persuasion". It's unnecessary to directly encode delegation into the system itself when we can just allow natural delegation in a simpler design. We ought to require that a voter actually changes their votes themselves, whatever that means in a particular system.
