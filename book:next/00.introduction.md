chapters:

- introduction
  - problems in the world, how I discovered hope
  - humanity's power comes from cooperation, and the methods we use to cooperate are just like a technology we can improve
  - we improve technologies with logical and scientific rigor, so it's reasonable to be more confident in one system of cooperation than another
  - but we still have to persuade people to cooperate and use these methods! we hope that them being more logically rigorous is good enough, but it frequently isn't, so we need to be pragmatic
  - this is the goal of this book, to propose better methods of cooperation, and get people all working together to improve them, rigorously verify them, and build real world movements and organizations that use them.
  - here are the main ideas, and hints about how they could help us end corporatism and consumerism, create shared prosperity, dissolve all monopolies including ones of intellectual property, create a more cohesive and emotionally harmonious culture, allow us to respond to the climate crisis, deradicalize fascists and fundamentalists,
  - the chapters aren't strictly categorized, and are just in the order we felt it was most natural and understandable. but there are a few broad themes: are there any obvious changes we can do right away? how can we take action in the economy in ways that don't require achieving political change? what should our government look like?
  - this is an open source book
- score voting systems: approval voting is an obvious change we can make right away
- resource voting systems and quadratic scaling: handling different levels of concern and shared costs
- persistent voting: making direct democracy possible
- persistent democracy: using persistent voting to solve common cooperation problems. this goes over the obvious and easy to explain ones, and hints at more involved uses
- democratic funding

- provably correct software
- computable governance code
- cryptographic transparency
- coordination theory

- economic cooperatives and economic activism
- persistently democratic member cooperative: building an economic institution to fight on our behalf
  - economic foundations, starting as an online-first credit union
  - journalism and media
  - internet, computing hinting at separate essay about misdirected blockchain enthusiasm, hint at public forum
  - housing
  - education

- democratic public forum

- persistently democratic political party: building a political institution to fight on our behalf

- minimum necessary rights
- markets and rights
- common resource taxes
- wealth taxes
- crowdsell intellectual property
- democratic districts
- free borders
- persistent logistics
- democratic adjudication
- misinformation rights
- universal voluntary constitution

- universities and coworking
- sustainability and anti-consumerism
- cohousing and urban planning

- climate action
  - especially nuclear power
  - already discussed externality and common resource taxes, so discuss carbon cap-and-trade, just like with sulfur-dioxide
- persuasive action


- waiting out the blockchain hype


formal theories:

- welfare theory
- progress theory
- peer network identity



formal theories are all in a separate folder and just referenced



footnotes that actually have text suck. better to have a collapsible element, or just use parentheses! true footnotes would just be possible links someone might find interesting *after* they're done reading your stuff


Retaking scale
Rigor and realism

There's no such thing as socialism or capitalism, only rights and public goods
and rights are only just another public good!

A noise and bot resistant public forum
Chaotic noise is inherently dangerous

We must absolutely destroy consumerism, but we can't live without industrialism

Giving profit incentives to do something positive is just allowing middle men to make money without doing anything real. They're just going to hire labor so all they can possibly do is make choices we should just make choices directly with persistent mechanisms

It's important to understand how we know things. Mathematical proof is one way, experience through experimentation is another. Whether our knowledge is persuasive is another matter we'll address later

Part of what makes corporations so powerful is that they don't require they much coordination. All the buyers just make simple self interested decisions and that powers the system forward
Member cooperatives inherit most of that advantage. Most members don't have to be super involved or vote that much, they just pay dues and get value in return
The big difference is in activation energy. For profit businesses get started because of greed, so again very little coordination is ultimately needed. Member cooperatives can be just as self sustaining, but they need activists to get the ball rolling

Ethical values vs organizational values
ethical values
Democratic ownership and control
Compassionate humanism, people are an end in themselves
Empirical humility


organizational values
Embracing and reclaim scientific rigor and industrial scale
Using empathetic persuasion, but be rigorous and detailed and show our work

Climate actions
Nuclear power
Cloud seeding
Methane control
Reforestation and rewilding
Cities with more plants

Wealth taxes can be thought of as a necessary way of avoiding market power, since a massive concentration of wealth creates market power in ALL markets. These players can exert market power by overwhelming the marginal utility function of key competitors and making their potential competition moot




main ideas
coordination is our superpower, and at large scales our coordination systems are a piece of technology rather than an intuitive part of our psychology
mathematical logic is the science behind improving our coordination systems, so we must use and trust them when doing *design*
but mathematical logic isn't effective at *persuading* people of the efficiency of these systems. we have to understand effective persuasion and aggressively pursue it


move logic chapter to blog, replace with the general initiative of first rigorously proving our ideas before verifying them, in order to be more confident when we try to persuade. first chapter instead talks about proof assistants as the prelude to the ideas and tools section, merely describing how rigorous we expect this to be
Make a correct government chapter and somehow split or merge the markets and rights chapter with the main rights chapter and wicked externalities
Principles
They only way out is through, we can't roll back industrialism, only reorient and redesign it
Democratic ownership and control. The only way to have any confidence new scaled or automated systems or civic systems are actually just is for all those concerned to have real power
The moral welfare motive instead of the profit motive


In rights chapter need to replace exclusion concept with rivalry
An ownership must necessarily deal with something rivalrous, since otherwise ownerships would collide



We can fix everything, a total plan to realize true democracy and prosperity, and solve the big problems of our age.

Many people are chipping away at our problems in isolation. Although they're doing good work, we think this strategy won't be successful for a few reasons:

- The problems are woven together, so the solutions can't work if they aren't as well.
- Different people take different approaches to the problems, and get in each other's way rather than pull in the same direction.
- It's difficult to get people excited or persuaded by a single solution to a single problem, not when they're aware of everything else that remains.

# top of mind
We have to fix everything: my harebrained scheme to solve the big problems of our age with a new political party.
By forming a comprehensive and unified platform with which to improve our world, I feel we can actually make progress instead of chipping away in isolation.

This is an extremely rough broad sketch of what I have in my head. A lot of it isn't fully formed yet, and I'll be honest about how confident I am about any particular idea, and honest about my emotional state about them. I realize a lot of this is probably extremely naive, but it's burning a hole in my mind, and I would love some kind of reality check. Is there anything here? Am I completely off the mark?

Our collective problems are intertwined and urgent, and our isolated efforts to solve them don't seem to be working.
It seems that we have to first address our basic societal mechanisms, since those are the most foundational structures we use to achieve all other forms of coordination. We can't solve real problems if we don't have a way of efficiently making group decisions.
The gordian knot, hope, and confidence. My idea for a democratically run political party with an open source book at the center.

Here are the other things the organization could do:
member dues
quadratic funding pool
experiment with holistic administration and a harm-reducing constitution
democratic forum for ideas/posts/initiatives

We already commit to use violence to defend people's rights, but now we do so without a consistent and rigorous definition of what those rights are. Forming a provably consistent foundation would give us a strictly better situation than the one we're currently in.




<!--
TODO this is all having trouble. I'm trying to say that we have more in common than we think, and this project is about discovering the shared values and truths underpinning different philosophies that fight with each other. We know it's difficult to unify/distill everyone's beliefs like this

rather than saying "we agree to disagree", we embrace hegelian synthesis. even if people end up doing different things, the foundation they stand on that justifies their differences should be unified.
we want to know where the real lines are. does someone *really* disagree in a way that's fundamentally incompatible? if that's really the case, we're destined to be separate or

perhaps this is one of the places where I should simply give low confidence? just say "I hope this is possible, we're going to try and we'll see what happens"?

should this book use the word "I" for now?


I want to distill and unify. if groups have disagreements, one of a few things is possible:
- the disagreement is based on misunderstandings and unclear thinking, and there exists some clear philosophy that they would all agree to (the ideas in this book could likely unify libertarians and democratic socialists, whereas their current ideas put them at each others' throats)
- the disagreement is mostly superficial, resting on a shared philosophy, and the differences are perfect tolerable within the philosophy (different groups can have different cultures and ways of thinking about their societies, but a shared system gives them basically compatible values and mechanisms for resolving conflict that allow them to coexist)
- the disagreement is fundamental, and the groups cannot coexist. when this is the case, conflict is inevitable, and will continue until one of the groups is removed in some way, either by converting/subsuming the other, or annihilating it.

politics is largely the aggregated attempts to mediate or understand conflict, between individuals and between groups.




to achieve our goals, the book will attempt to answer a few crucial questions:

- how should rights work? can we discover a system of rights that philosophically/morally/mathematically sound? can we discover one that's provably optimal?
- how does that rights system impact how we should think about our governance structures? can we discover governance structures that provably optimally protect rights? what consequences does these rights/governance systems have on how we think about conflict/cooperation across cultures? how does it impact things like control of resources?







This is a huge goal that might not even be possible, we fully understand that. But we have confidence that our proposed philosophies and solutions are sound, and that a spirit of democratic cooperation and synthesis can take us the rest of the way. If you also care about these big problems, and want to help us figure out solutions and make them happen, please read on and get involved! We would love to hear what you think.




## Beliefs that determine our Ideas:
These determine the kinds of solutions we'll espouse.

**Every person has a unique and irreplaceable life experience of intrinsic moral worth.**

The consequences of this axiom are extremely important, and essentially form the philosophical foundation for democracy and equal rights. The book itself goes into much greater detail.

- Plurality. Every one of us has a perspective and an internal life that no one else can fully understand or access. This means everyone's desires are equally important.
- Compassion. Every one of us
- Democracy.
- Liberty. Every one of us should be free to make any choice we wish, only limited by how much our choices impact the choices of others.
- Prosperity. Every one of us should have equal share to the resources necessary to live a full and rich life, only limited by how much our share impacts the share of others. By increasing our shared ability to use and create resources, each of us becomes more economically free.

Some of these are in tension with one another, and navigating those tensions is a large part of our mission.


All our solutions can be graded on two scales: confidence (how confident are we that this solution is one that will move us in a good direction?), and tractability (how easy is this to realistically do right now?)
Any idea that we believe is both tractable and confident will get actual organized action to start attacking it. And our other efforts are spent trying to make ideas we're confident in more tractable, or gain confidence in other ideas.
First confidence, then action for tractability, then organized action.

-->


# The Book

since we're attacking such a complex tapestry of problems, our solutions aren't going to fall into neat categories. rather than having all our ideas categorized and ordered in sections such as "governance" or "economics", we instead merely order them according to the most intuitive order to encounter them. many of these ideas build on each other, and so they are presented in order of dependency. since complexity/dependency and tractability tend to go so hand in hand, the sections are also therefore roughly ordered by how immediately we can start applying the ideas, and then to have a "theory/application theory/application" pattern.

## the near future, what can we do right away?

## theories and mechanisms, what foundation are we building on? what tools can we use?

## cooperative economics, what institutions can we build without needing to change the government? applying theories and mechanisms to the "private" sphere.

## a new holistic constitution, applying theories and mechanisms to the "public" sphere.

## climate change, and a new human ecosystem, what we think the best path forward is and how the mechanisms can get us there.

## de-radicalizing the right: resisting fascism and unifying our culture



---


Perhaps the right way to frame this movement isn't to focus on the problems, but on creating a truly democratic world. Blog posts and things can detail how these ideas solve the big problems.


A truly democratic society, where the rights of all are complete and fully protected, and fairly balanced where they conflict.
That leads to a society where prosperity is enjoyed equally, while still providing incentive to do valuable work.


# We can fix everything, and we have no choice but to try.

As a global society, we're facing a lot of very serious and very difficult problems.

- **Government inefficiency and corruption.** Almost no government is truly representative and democratic, many are outright authoritarian, and basically all have serious problems with waste and graft. Good governance is a tricky problem, and we haven't solved it yet.

- **Police unaccountability and systemic injustice.** Crime and punishment in almost all societies is an expression of class power structures rather than the democratic will to defend everyone's rights.

- **Economic inequality, consumerism, corporatism.** Our economies are dominated by massive corporations, who instead of creating prosperity, derive much of their power from exploiting weaknesses in various systems, such as those in political institutions, human psychology, or markets that can be easily made into oligopolies.

- **Climate change, environmental destruction.** Erratic and severe weather patterns are already beginning to disrupt communities and create increased resource uncertainty and scarcity. We routinely destroy natural resources that both underpin our planet's economic value and are irreplaceably beautiful.

- **Misinformation, disinformation, surveillance capitalism.** It is now trivially easy for any group with spare resources to pollute our shared information ecosystem with misunderstandings or outright lies. The structure of attention capitalism rewards these kinds of behaviors and increasingly addicts us all to a world of shallow entertainment and consumerist indulgence.

- **Resurgence of fascism and authoritarianism.** The success of various social justice movements around the world and increased economic instability have empowered a new wave of fascist movements, and many governments have eagerly adopted technological methods of surveillance and control. Violent and irrational forms of market and social fundamentalism have been deeply inculcated into many populations.

These are serious problems! Each of them individually would be incredibly dangerous and destructive, and together they threaten to permanently destroy our species hopes of prosperity, dignity, and freedom.

It's also important to notice that each is interrelated to all the others. They reinforce and exacerbate one another, tying the whole collection into a paralyzing Gordian knot.

## So what should we do?

I routinely encounter young and idealistic people who simply throw up their hands when confronted with these big problems, and I can't help but sympathize. This is an unfair burden to be placed on any generation, and thinking of fixing it all is overwhelming.

<!-- The motivation here is that whenever I talk to idealistic people, they inevitably express despair and hopelessness, thinking that the problems we're facing are simply too massive and too intractable and too entangled for us to have any hope of making real progress.
But we think we have solutions that will work! And we're interested in getting feedback from everyone else to understand if we're actually right.
-->

But here's the thing: **we don't have any choice.** If we don't solve these problems, they will steadily dismantle our societies, and possibly even destroy us entirely.

We have the **obligation** of hope. If we don't (perhaps arrogantly) assume that we can figure it out, that we can overcome all these challenges and make a better world, then our failure is a foregone conclusion. We **have** to stare these hard realities in the face, and do the difficult work to find real solutions.

<!-- And we actually do believe that we can do it! Using the tools of mathematically balanced democratic mechanisms, cooperative economics, and holistic governance. We hope to persuade you that we're right. -->

## We're determined to discover and implement those solutions.

We believe that with rigorous philosophical, scientific, historical, cultural, and mathematical thinking, we can discover ways to organize our governments and social institutions that make them truly democratic, fair, efficient, and compassionate.

We don't just want to discover solutions in an ivory tower however. If our solutions are going to be moral and effective, they have to be deeply convincing and inspiring to a broad range of people, from many different cultures and viewpoints.

To do this, this project itself must be democratically controlled, and therefore committed to constant evolution and synthesis of different opinions. Only then can we hope to unify the efforts of all those already diligently working in areas such as democratic reform, justice reform, environmental justice, social justice, internet freedom, and anti-fascism. These efforts must be coordinated with each other if they're really going to be effective. The problems are woven together, the solutions must be too.

This book represents our best attempt to clearly state our shared beliefs and values, and discover a unified set of solutions to these big problems. We hope to then build a movement that can gradually and democratically improve the book, and coordinate the work necessary to implement the solutions.

<!--
- Unified and complete. This project is slowly working towards solutions in many problems in parallel, meaning that there's actually some hope of getting somewhere.
- Open source. By not predicating contribution to membership in an organization, we can coordinate very efficiently and accept useful contributions from anyone who's able to make them.
- Evergreen. Rather than publishing a timeline of more or less "one-off" articles or papers, this website is instead treated as a "living book", one that can be updated to reflect new understanding and problems.
-->

## This is a huge goal. How can we do it?

History is littered with movements with grand visions who were undermined by unrealistic expectations, insufficient resources, infighting, corruption, or sabotage by opponents. To give ourselves the best chance of success, we have to hold ourselves to high principles while at the same time not letting them bog us down and keep us from achieving our goals.

To do this, it helps to make a distinction between mission, principles, and values.

### Mission

<!--
Bring about a truly democratic world, where rights are protected for all, and abundant prosperity is enjoyed by all.
 -->


This is the long term goal we're trying to achieve. Our mission clarifies the work we care about versus what we consider a distraction.

**Find solutions, persuade the others, do the work.**

- **Find solutions.** We want to find solutions to our world's biggest and most important problems. The solutions we find have to be as close as we can manage to being perfectly correct. Doing this will require a lot of concerted effort, research, and experimentation.
- **Persuade the others.** We can't implement solutions alone, and we can't do so against everyone else's will. We have to be consistently persuasive and open. Our solutions must inspire confidence and action. They must be moral and inclusive.
- **Do the work.** It isn't enough to write papers. Real things have to change, from governments to companies to individuals, and we have to make that change happen.

### Principles

These are hard constraints that we expect to be adhered to in all circumstances. These are the source of our community's integrity.

- **Democracy.** No organization is truly open and inclusive if all its members aren't in control. All decision-making authority flows from members. Top leadership positions are selected democratically, and if a decision can be made democratically directly by members it should be.
- **Transparency.** Secrets are basically never necessary, and are poison to communities. If something effects others in any meaningful way, they should know about it. Only individual private matters should remain so.
- **Honesty.** Lies destroy trust and harm others. There is never any reason to lie or be misleading.
- **Humility.** We don't know everything, and never will. We must clearly state the limits of our knowledge.
- **Decency.** Everyone is expected to behave considerately, and treat all others with dignity and kindness.

We have a community code of conduct to enforce these principles.
https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct
https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md

### Values

These are qualities we aspire to in our work, but that may sometimes conflict with each other or be imperfect. We are always trying to get better.

- Rigor. Honest people should consider our arguments to be empirically and logically unassailable. When we stand behind a claim, we should do so with the reinforcement of detailed, specific, corroborated evidence, or provably logical argument. We believe our ideas will be more successful and believable the closer they are to the real truth.

<!-- The only reasonable disagreement anyone could have with our positions is that they have a completely different worldview. -->

- Inclusivity. We believe rigor speaks for itself, and we do everything we can to clearly document what rigor looks like and how we measure it, as well as using repeatable automated tools. This means that anyone, from any background and with any education, can make just as valuable contributions as a recognized scholar. We also have collected resources to help people advance their skills and become a stronger member of our movement. Lists of useful learning materials, opportunities, and productivity/wellness advice are all available. This allows anyone to improve themselves and therefore their contributions.

- Persuasiveness. What we say should not merely be rigorously true, but must also successfully convince people who don't already agree. We should endeavor to make our arguments compelling and undeniable even to the most staunch detractor.

- Candor. We are compelled to speak the truth, even when it is difficult. Objectivity is for academics, and being rigorous isn't the same as being objective. We have specific beliefs, and we will clearly state them, and call out those in the world who act in ways we consider unacceptable. However we choose to attack the actions, not the person, and leave open the door for that person to do the right thing for the right reasons. We don't have to water down our beliefs to maintain the moral and civic high ground.

<!-- We respect those who speak candidly, even if we disagree with what they are saying. -->

- Synthesis. When we encounter new ideas that seem to contradict ours but could be compatible, we do our best to distill our understanding to include those new ideas. We hope to unify many different perspectives with philosophies and solutions that comfortably accommodate them all.

- Comprehensiveness. We hope to find a coordinated plan to solve all the biggest problems, so we try to be thorough. Everyone who identifies with our mission should find what they need to go forward. we want this to be a single place people can look to know how to help or what we should do. it should be complete enough to be adopted as a party platform. it should be navigable enough that people can find answers to their questions. in situations where someone else is doing the real useful work, we can simply point to them, but we should strive to either contain or point to all the aspects we think will be necessary to fix everything.

- Clarity. Say precisely what you mean as briefly as you can. Don't use unnecessarily academic or flowery language.

- Pragmatism. We want to make real changes in the real world, and we must be honest about what can realistically be achieved, by who, and on what timescale.

<!--
All our solutions can be graded on two scales: tractability (how easy is this to realistically do right now?), and confidence (how confident are we that this solution is one that will move us in a good direction?)
Any idea that we believe is both tractable and confident will get actual organized action to start attacking it. And our other efforts are spent trying to make ideas we're confident in more tractable, or gain confidence in other ideas.
First confidence, then action for tractability, then organized action.
-->

- Idealism. Things can get better! It's difficult to be hopeful sometimes, but we have the obligation to try.

<!-- https://oxide.computer/about/ -->

## Let's get this done together.

There are a few places you can go from here, depending on what you'd like to learn and how you'd like to help.

- The Book. This is an "evergreen" description of our beliefs and proposals.
- The Actions. Some of our ideas are ready to be implemented or tried, and the action area describes groups or institutions doing concrete work you could choose to join.
- The Blog. These are more "one-off" articles exploring our ideas in ways that are too narrow to be included in the book, such as reacting to current events. We do this mostly to give people entry points to understand our ideas and how they could make things better.
- The Codex. To support our resolution to be rigorous, we compile summaries and references of valuable works by different experts, such as books, papers, and documentaries. The codex summarizes these works, and describes how their conclusions relate to our goals.


<!-- Also, this is certainly a liberal project. However, I'm very interested in creating true consensus through creative problem-solving and effective persuasion. Also, I'm a former diehard libertarian who's now an anti-capitalist, but who still understands the inherent tension between collective goals and scarcity of resources. I want to find a way to synthesize market mechanisms with progressive ideals. However I genuinely believe that progressives, socialists, anarchists, moderate liberals, technocratic liberals, and libertarian minded conservatives can all fit in this movement. My goal is synthesis, not exclusion. The only group we simply have to commit to persuading is religious fundamentalists and other groups on the fascistic spectrum. -->

<!-- I genuinely believe part of the reason we haven't been able to form a powerful movement is because the existing ideas aren't convincing! If people look at an idea and say "that isn't really a good idea" or "that idea will never work", then they won't join a movement centered around that idea. Quality ideas have a stronger "gravitational pull", and are better capable of inspiring confidence

If you have an extremely difficult but rewarding goal, but your proposed strategy is lousy then no one will follow you, *even if attaining the rewards would be worth the effort*. People won't sign up to join a project they don't think is actually going to work.

filecoin and ipfs are doing better than other file storage systems because they're building on more convincing and more complete strategies. -->

<!-- I'm compensating for not being an expert in all the problem areas by making it open. It would be nice to have a one stop shop for people trying to figure out how to help to solve our urgent problems.
the gordian knot

The goal would be to go beyond what any individual author(s) could achieve with a traditional book, by allowing it to evolve and change and have many contributors, rather than be hemmed in by a publishing deadline. -->
