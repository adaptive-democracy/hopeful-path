# Blockchains and DAOs aren't going to fix society, but persistent democracy and cooperatives could

Many of us have identified the problem of large concentrations of power in our society, and are trying to fix that problem. One of the suggested paths that has been getting a lot of attention is using trustless consensus networks or blockchain technology to enable decentralized collaboration, coordination, ownership, and governance. An idea that has received an especially large amount of attention recently is the concept of a DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, which is essentially when a set of rules coded as computer programs are placed on a blockchain and then are capable of automatically performing the functions of an organization.

I'm very interested in all these concepts, mostly for technical reasons, and I do think they'll be useful in *some* way eventually. I've even come up with my own [decentralized consensus algorithm](TODO). But as interested as I am in blockchains, I'm skeptical they'll actually solve the problems many say they'll solve, not for technological reasons since those can be solved or mitigated, but societal and economic reasons.

My assertion is this: we don't *need* blockchains to decentralize power and solve our thorniest coordination problems. We just need better *voting methods* and systems for *democratic ownership and control*. And specifically I think [Persistent Democracy](TODO) and [widespread member cooperatives](TODO) are the next massive improvement we should make.

Of course blockchains can be *used* to create trustless cryptographic transparency, which could be useful for any persistently democratic system. However that extremely high degree of transparency is just "nice to have", and isn't strictly necessary. We can accomplish our goals with a lot less. [This simple update mirroring system](TODO) gets a large percentage of the benefits of a blockchain without being nearly as complex, and while it also isn't nearly as robust, it doesn't really matter.

The only thing we need to do is effectively work together. That's [humanity's superpower](TODO), the thing that's allowed us to achieve everything we've achieved. Our systems of large-scale decision making are just showing their age, and need to be upgraded. Blockchains could be a part of that upgrade, but they absolutely don't need to be.

And we must point out that blockchains, at least in the way they're mostly being pursued, could actually make things *worse*. The overwhelming trend in these products is toward "financialization", or trying to turn everything into a market and every interaction into a financially evaluable transaction. I don't think the people realize how narrow and specific a worldview you have to have accepted in order to think that's a good idea, and aren't considering the myriad ways that can go wrong. Markets are *just one* of the tools for coordination we have, and they can create problems just as easily as solve them. Greed and consumptive competition can just as easily be forces for destruction and degradation as incentives for innovation.

Ultimately all of this comes down to actually enforceable ownership and control, which come from communities and systems of justice. Blockchains only have knowledge about computational things, and don't have real jurisdiction over anything. "All real power comes from the barrel of a gun", and blockchains are only capable of keeping a ledger. Actually enforcing that ledger is always going to be a messy human process grounded in the real world. We don't need to subvert or circumvent our governments, we need to fix them.

Creating uncensorable decentralized digital markets can only solve a tiny percentage of our problems. Governments aren't powerful because they control our monetary system, they're powerful because they control land, physical resources, and the loyalty of people. And importantly *that's the point of a government!* We created democratic governments because we recognized our shared need to solve problems and create public goods *in the real world*, ones relating to land and resources that none of us could solve by ourselves. If our governments have become inefficient or corrupt or unfair, then no amount of darknet markets will change that. Fiat currencies are useful *because they are mandated by fiat!* We created legal tender laws to avoid the purely deadweight loss that came from [every bank issuing their own banknote currencies](TODO), where everyone had to wade through the sea of different currency valuations. Fiat currencies remove all that coordination overhead, which is most of the value they provide.

If a currency stably maintains some non-negative inflation rate, then it will always roughly encode the amount of latent value in an economy, whether that economy is growing or shrinking. A fiat system allows us to create these kinds of rational currencies, and removes the need to tie up scarce resources as stores of value that would be better used in other ways. Tying up large amounts of gold to use as the currency backing is wasteful when that it could be better used in industrial machinery, chemical processes, or electronics. Tying up computers capable of providing hashpower and electricity running them is wasteful when they could be better used doing useful information processing or powering other devices.


provide very basic idea of welfare theory

There are three reasons why blockchains aren't necessary, or could make things worse:

- Blockchains can only create efficient markets for purely computational resources.
- Even if these purely computational markets are perfectly efficient, all they can do is encode the true scarcity underneath them, the scarcity of electricity and chips. This will merely continue to propagate the same inequities that already exist in our societies. The problems of the internet come from irrational rights in intellectual property, land, and
- A ledger that isn't enforced in real life is useless. We need to fix our governments not subvert or circumvent them.
- Cryptocurrencies are actually probably mostly harmful, precisely because they aren't fiat, which means they're unaccountable and incentivize wasteful coordination that doesn't add value. If anything we should just use these algorithms to create a governmental public good currency, combining the benefits of both.
- Financialization is bad.
- Almost all tokenomic models are just irrational, and won't do anything to solve the public goods problem. The only real solution to the public goods problem is to simply prevent free-riding, which can only really be done through some form of exclusion, such as taxing access to land. After that we just have to figure out [how to spend shared resources](TODO persistent funding).

We can't create scarcity where there isn't actually any, or remove scarcity where there truly is some.








we don't really need many of the kinds of decentralization people are playing around with right now

if you aren't doing cutting edge research in computational cryptography, distributed systems, or economics, then you aren't really doing useful work to forward blockchains. the best you can do is create buzz. the only notable exceptions are systems that are attempt to encode real *computational* scarcity (only computational because its the only kind of scarcity that can be verified by these networks without outside organizations) and therefore create a perfectly fluid decentralized market for a real good or service. so protocols that encode useful storage or computational capacity to the network are already completely useful, such as filecoin or dfinity, etc. very importantly, since only protocols that encode *real* scarcity will ultimately survive, this means *these protocols will do nothing to qualitatively reverse wealth inequality or centralized control*. real wealth and power comes from ownership and control of truly scarce resources, so if these protocols merely encode real scarcity, existing holders of vast resources will remain the most powerful actors in new systems. these protocols will merely make markets more efficient, not reverse the rights abuses that created the status quo. mere markets are not the same thing as true democracy
decentralized protocols aren't going to give small actors access to [rack-scale or even data-center scale hardware design](https://oxide.computer/), so although they won't be entirely locked out of the compute market, they'll still be massively outmatched by centralized players in the large number of non-niche computing cases.

decentralized *identity* is the most important unsolved problem.

importantly, NFTs aren't the thing that will change how we think about property. without enforcement, a deed of ownership is completely useless. if we want to revolutionize our understanding of property, we have to do so at the governmental level. however, blockchains can be invaluable in giving our governments a secure and transparent computational foundation.


the only systems that really have immediate utility are filecoin and other systems that are rooted in *real* scarcity.

tokenomics as an idea has been dramatically over-applied. if a currency doesn't stably maintain a rough inflation rate, then it isn't actually valuable as a currency. if a token is ostensibly a "utility token" but its price isn't inexorably tied to the real scarcity limiting the underlying work then it's irrational and will be out-competed by something else

there's a theoretical limit of these kinds of semi-cooperative decentralized ledgers, which is one that has zero (marginal) transaction costs, changes state fast enough to be below the threshold of human perception, and is only limited by real computational scarcity. however such a system would completely nullify the two primary incentive systems in the blockchain space (artificially scarce coins that will speculatively rise in value, transaction fees). however such a system *is* possible if the network has a model of "mutual obligation" where each person-linked account is simply expected to do work to secure and audit the ledger, and is exiled if it doesn't meet its obligations or commits fraud. the only way to pay for the development of such a system is with public goods funding, since by its very design it doesn't allow any other funding models. and again, that design achieves a theoretical limit of usefulness! so if we *have* a way of provisioning public goods enough to fund such a thing, then it will inevitably replace and outstrip other models


fiat currencies are useful *because* they are fiat currencies, their value as a social technology is entirely defined by these two qualities:

- they maintain a roughly stable inflation, *therefore* roughly encoding the real scarcity of available labor and resources in the underlying economy
- they are enforced as a legal tender, removing all the deadweight loss from all the coordination costs necessary in secondary currency markets. standardization and unification are useful!


If a monetary system has any stable, non negative inflation rate then it will rationally track any economy, possibly even if its shrinking?





the only real difference between a DAO and a democratic member cooperative is that a DAO makes all decisions on a blockchain. a normal institution can automate governance in the exact same way by using [computable legal code](TODO), so there's nothing inherently different about that. and crypto bros are fooling themselves if they think a DAO can escape the need for actual humans to follow its decisions when they need to be translated to reality. DAOs that aren't either entirely digital will never be able to escape the need for a pairing with legal code.
then the only thing I really want to bring about is an identity-based blockchain that operates through mutual obligation rather than speculative finance incentives, recentering labor rather than assets.

in a mutual obligation network????

- if you create more computational or storage work, you don't necessarily have to *pay* for all that on the network, but you do have to pay for it in your local version and you are the one expected to validate others are replicating it properly.
- or your obligation to others increases. this is ultimately just like a currency?? except that this network obligation can't be transferred?
- oh oh or we simply use democratic weights to allocate obligation at any one time! rather than burning currency we simply prioritize work according to a democratic weighting. if it's possible for an actor or group to do more computation upfront on their own and therefore decrease the amount of work necessary by the network then we can still let people spend physical resources in order to make more complex things happen faster

it's the same as any cooperative good: in order to be a part of the cooperative, you have to provide the same amount of utility to the cooperative, and you get access to the benefits as a cooperative as a result. you have the same right to cooperative goods as everyone else as represented by your democratic weights, and at

all property is backed up by enforcement

utility tokens don't make any sense
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12525-020-00412-9

something only has *true* value if the value is intrinsic and robust to adversarialism, only if it encodes true scarcity in a way that will actually be honored.

a protocol that requires users to pay for potentially artificially scarce utility tokens in order to use the "service" will always be outcompeted in the limit by a merely open source system that only requires users to pay for whatever real network resources are required to run it



human value is nothing other than (is defined as)
the experience of welfare (or utility)
enabled by access to scarce resources
facilitated by labor

the short version: resources facilitated by labor

things are only valuable to the degree they somehow point downward at these basic concepts

stocks for example are only valuable because they entitle the holder to shares of future profits (and votes regarding those profits and the right to sell the share), and those profits can be used to trade for resources or labor that produce welfare

do we really need blockchains? are compute cooperatives good enough?
is an identity membership chain good enough?
can we just store nothing but current membership and standing and seal snapshots/hashes and nothing else?

daos don't uniquely enable anything other than cryptographic transparency of code operation
democratic cooperative ownership principles are the thing that enables actual freedom

daos don't solve the value attribution problem, arguably the most important and valuable unsolved problem for humanity. it will likely end up being some messy blend of an algorithm and mere democracy
