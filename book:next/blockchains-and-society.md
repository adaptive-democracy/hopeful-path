# Blockchains aren't going to fix society, but persistent democracy and cooperatives could

Many of us have identified the problem of large concentrations of power in our society, and are trying to fix that problem. One of the solutions receiving attention is to use trustless consensus networks or blockchain technology to enable decentralized collaboration, coordination, ownership, and governance. There are many proposed applications of this technology, from DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and of course the idea that started it all, cryptocurrencies.

I'm very interested in all these concepts, mostly for technical reasons, and I do think they'll be useful in *some* way eventually. I've even come up with my own [decentralized consensus algorithm](TODO). But as interested as I am in blockchains, I'm skeptical they'll actually solve the problems people say they'll solve. Not for technological reasons, those can be solved or mitigated with more research and iteration, but for societal and economic reasons.

My assertion is this: blockchains aren't terribly useful for decentralizing real power or solving our biggest coordination problems. In fact in most cases they're worse than nothing and are actively causing harm and distracting time and resources away from better solutions. I don't think it will be helpful to pursue extremely complicated systems that will make our society less cohesive, more anonymous, and more market-like.

We need to instead build methods that better enable real negotiation, cohesion, and social cooperation. We need drastically better voting methods and systems for democratic ownership and control. Specifically I'd like to put forward [Persistent Democracy and widespread member cooperatives](TODO) as the next truly exciting ideas we should be aggressively pursuing.

Blockchains could of course be used within persistently democratic governments and cooperatives to create trustless cryptographic transparency. However that extremely high degree of transparency is just "nice to have", and is way more than we really need. [This simple publicly linked receipt system](TODO) gets a large percentage of the benefits of a blockchain without being nearly as complex.

**The only thing we need to do is effectively work together.** That's [humanity's superpower](TODO), the thing that's allowed us to achieve everything we've achieved. Our systems of large-scale decision making are just showing their age, and need to be upgraded. Blockchains could be a part of that upgrade, but they absolutely aren't required.

The rest of this essay will pull apart some economic ideas related to blockchains, and discuss the ways in which their currently proposed uses are either ineffective or actively harmful.

But before I indulge in all that negativity and criticism, I want to point you toward hope. If you're one of the people who genuinely wants to make the world a better place, and think we have to find some way to break up large concentrations of power and make the world more democratic, then I appreciate you, even if you've been wrapped up in the blockchain space. Please go read about [Persistent Democracy and cooperatives](TODO), I hope to work together as we make things better.

# A simple theory of economic value

First let's agree on a simple foundation, a shared understanding of what economic value really is.

Economic value is nothing more than:

- the emotional experience of [welfare or utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism),
- created by access to or usage of scarce resources,
- facilitated by useful labor.

All of those things must be present. If something doesn't create positive welfare for someone at some level, then it has no value. If it isn't scarce, then it is by definition intrinsic to the human experience and so, although valuable in a philosophical or moral sense, not valuable in an economic sense. And all access or usage of scarce resources is mediated by labor in some way, even if its merely the labor of going into nature and finding scarce resources by oneself.

Things are only valuable to the degree they somehow point downward at these basic concepts. Food and shelter are valuable because they create and enable welfare. Money is useful because it acts as a way for people to fluidly trade scarce labor and resources. Even stocks and stock markets, despite it being likely that stock markets have become very irrational and distorted in many ways at many times, are underpinned by the legal entitlement of the holder to shares of future company profits, votes regarding those profits, and the right to sell the share.

And of course we can explain why people create institutions not intended for simple monetary profit such as governments and cooperatives. These institutions are intended as enablers of cooperation, vehicles to create valuable shared goods that no member of the cooperating group could build on their own, or that would have their value undermined by being wrapped in [systems of excludability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excludability). Infrastructure like roads or utility services, contributions to commons such as our culture or body of scientific and technological understanding, and even the very concepts of a legal system or national defense are all public goods that are uniquely suited to being provided in a cooperative manner.

The unfair concentrations of power in our society [are produced by inefficient definitions of legal control](https://www.thwink.org/sustain/glossary/CumulativeAdvantagePrinciple.htm), and so disrupt the creation of welfare by allowing extractive actors to exert undue power over others. The [idea of common partial ownership](TODO) is built to solve this problem, but that's not the topic of this essay.

When looking at the ways blockchains are irrational, we'll tend to see them violating a few ideas:

- Our biggest problems exist in the real world, not in the digital world. Their solutions must follow suit.
- Ownership doesn't exist without enforcement, which only exists when created by cooperation within a society.
- True scarcity is non-negotiable. It doesn't work to either create scarcity where there isn't any, or to ignore scarcity where there is.
- The public goods funding problem can't be solved with mere financial incentives, since that does nothing to change true scarcity and excludability. Only systems that truly remove free-riding, like systems of taxation, can possibly do so.
- Financialization and markets are just one of the many tools we have for solving problems, and aren't suited to many. Not every interaction can be a financially evaluable transaction. Greed and competition can just as easily be forces for destruction and degradation as incentives for innovation.

Let's go through a few of the main proposed use cases of blockchains, and see why they either make things no better, or make things worse.

# Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

The main idea of NFTs is that they enable each token to be unique compared to all others. They're mostly used as deeds of ownership for goods that aren't equivalent to each other, such as pieces of art or land.

However a deed of ownership is meaningless if it can't be enforced. If we want to revolutionize our understanding of property, we have to do so at the governmental level. Perhaps blockchains can be used as the ledger used by a government, but we can easily see that the governmental structure provides all the value, the blockchain is just a better accounting system. We can remove the blockchain ledger and still get the value, but if we remove the functioning government we get nothing more than a bunch of data on computers.

Many notable uses of NFTs also try to create scarcity in places where there isn't any. Things like art, quality journalism, technological designs, or research papers are scarce because the skilled labor of artists, journalists, designers, engineers, and researchers is scarce. Being able to digitally track ownership of knowledge work, something that inherently cannot be truly owned, does nothing to change that. [Fixing the way we think about funding knowledge work](TODO) doesn't require blockchains in any way.

# Utility Tokens

Utility tokens are essentially just tokens that enable someone to receive some kind of services from a blockchain network. However in almost all cases they aren't presented as mere "gift cards", but a tradable asset that will increase in value as the network becomes more useful as it gains network effects. The promise is that early adopters will be rewarded for their foresight by being able to buy early while prices are low.

The idea that these two forms of use can go together [just doesn't make any sense](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12525-020-00412-9). Why would someone use up a thing that was increasing in value? And if no one is using their tokens because they expect them to increase in price, won't that harm the network and make it less valuable? In a reasonable service network, prices merely reflect the ratio between supply and demand, and don't need an arbitrary secondary market between participants who provide no supply to the network.
<!-- the financial gain for the token owner associated with a positive change in token value has a negative effect on the platform overall. As the token owner decides between holding and using the token, the financial incentive to hold the token lowers the willingness to pay for the good. Thus, the overall demand for the good declines and results in a negative effect for sellers. This implies that a growth in trading volume from t1 to t2 (i.e., platform usage) leading to a higher token valuation has a direct negative impact on demand for the good in t1. -->

This is again an attempt to create scarcity where there isn't any. Using a service is valuable merely to gain the benefits of the service. *Early* usage of a service network does nothing to uniquely entitle a person to promise of financial gain. If you want to buy something that entitles you to future returns in a venture, then you don't buy the right to *use* that venture, but the right to *own* it, which is literally just the ancient idea of a stock or security, a form of scarcity that's enforced by governments and opportunity costs. The two purposes are contradictory. It only makes sense for *production* to be rewarded, not consumption.

A system that requires users to pay for *artificially* scarce utility tokens will always be outcompeted in the limit by systems that only require them to pay based on true scarcity of supply. The price for something must remain tied to whatever true scarcity limits its supply. Any hope of financial gain can only come from ownership of a *truly* scarce and valuable good.

Data protocols and open networks can be public goods just like anything else. We just need [public goods funding systems](TODO) to pay for the labor needed to make them.

# Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

DAOs are organizations that exist merely as a set of smart contracts that automatically perform actions in response to network activity. The touted benefit of such an organization is that it requires no labor overhead to manage and can't be corrupted or taken over. This is the first application that actually delivers a new form of value, since those aspects of DAOs are true!

However, I assert that those aspects aren't nearly as important, and won't be nearly as transformative as many say. Proponents argue that efficient and perfectly democratic networks can be created that deliver the same value as cooperatives. While that is technically true, I argue that it is much more difficult and much more dangerous to fully trust such an automated system than it is to just design better normal institutions.

The entire unique benefit of a blockchain application is that it is immutable, and that the system is blind to any aspects not directly designed into its programming. This is where decentralization and censorship resistance come from, and any compromise away from those qualities slowly makes a DAO less and less decentralized.

And making those kinds of compromises is a very good idea! No one can foresee all the potential problems a protocol or organization might encounter enough to write smart contracts that will always make the right choice. Even if a group of smart contracts was [logically proven to be correct](TODO), and all the specifications and assumptions undergirding those proofs were perfect, users of the system will make honest mistakes or be taken advantage of in completely non-computational ways. Without social systems of governance that allow us to react and negotiate as circumstances change, we would be forced to live with any destruction caused by past errors. Data isn't actually permanent, so this seems like a poor choice. Similarly, smart contract code cannot possibly effect anything in the real world without real people agreeing to honestly follow its judgments, so without any social foundation a DAO can only hope to mediate purely computational exchanges.

DAOs don't add any unique value that can't be gained with a persistently democratic cooperative. In order to actually enforce the judgments of a DAO, or evolve how it works, or protect it from unforeseen errors, it needs to be grounded in legal institutions and systems, which defeats the entire purpose of bothering with a DAO. The only real difference between a DAO and a democratic member cooperative is that a DAO makes all decisions on a blockchain. A normal institution can automate governance in the exact same way by using [computable legal code](TODO), and stay transparent [using a publicly linked receipt system](TODO), so again we can gain basically all the benefits of blockchains without actually using them.

We can decentralize *ownership and control* without decentralizing *the organization*. Yes, that does mean we need functional legal systems, but that's an unavoidable reality anyway, even for basically all DAOs. Besides, without functional legal systems, this all becomes pretty moot. Does it matter that you can make perfectly anonymous online trades if your real life rights aren't respected?

# Cryptocurrencies

The entire value of a fiat currency is the very fact that it's fiat! Money is just a social technology, a system we create to allow ourselves to fluidly trade without having to figure out complex bartering schemes or lug around heavy things like gold. In order to make them the most useful possible versions of themselves, we've designed them to follow two rules:

- They maintain a roughly stable inflation rate, therefore roughly encoding the real scarcity of available labor and resources in the underlying economy. If more money is created whenever new resources or capacity for labor is created, such that costs of existing resources and labor stay roughly the same price, then the new money roughly aligns with the new value that's been created. If a currency has a stable, non-negative inflation rate then it will rationally track any economy.
- They are enforced as [legal tender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_tender), meaning that the currency is question must be accepted to discharge debts. [Private currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_currency#Private_bank_notes) incur pure deadweight loss any time they aren't accepted as payment for a debt or must be traded on a secondary market. Standardization and unification are useful! A government is uniquely suited to provision a public good such as a nationally fluid currency, and to bear all costs of enforcement.

Of course a corrupt or ineffective government can distort or mismanage a currency. But can't a corrupt or ineffective bank or blockchain company as well? [We don't need to subvert or circumvent our governments, we need to fix them.](TODO persistent democracy)

A fiat system allows us to create rational currencies, and removes the need to tie up scarce resources as stores of value that would be better used in other ways. Tying up large amounts of gold to use as the currency backing is wasteful when that it could be better used in industrial machinery, chemical processes, or electronics. Tying up computers and electricity is wasteful when they could be better used doing useful information processing or powering other devices.

If anything, blockchains should just be used as a foundation for government issued currencies in order to increase transparency and reduce infrastructural and enforcement costs. However such currencies would have to be designed very differently to make sense.

# Decentralized Computing Markets

Systems like [Filecoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filecoin), [Dfinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dfinity), and of course [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) all

this at first seems like the most reasonable application of blockchains. they actually are! mining the coin by providing computably tangible value to a network is completely reasonable.

and its definitely true the technology itself will undoubtedly work, but it won't have the *social* effects many say. computing scarcity is determined by real life scarcity, so the unfair systems that can protect real life scarcity will protect computing scarcity. nothing will indelibly change unless the systems *around* computing are fixed. ownership and control of scarce resources is what really determines power, not the ability to technically operate on anonymous decentralized networks.

decentralized protocols aren't going to give small actors access to [rack-scale or even data-center scale hardware design](https://oxide.computer/), so although they won't be entirely locked out of the compute market, they'll still be massively outmatched by centralized players in the large number of non-niche computing cases.

zero-knowledge computation is very cool, but given how insanely more expensive it is, wouldn't it be better for people to just control machines? or have legal control over an institution and have real capability to seek legal redress if officers of that institution break the rules?

the only notable exceptions are systems that are attempt to encode real *computational* scarcity (only computational because its the only kind of scarcity that can be verified by these networks without outside organizations) and therefore create a perfectly fluid decentralized market for a real good or service. so protocols that encode useful storage or computational capacity to the network are already completely useful, such as filecoin or dfinity, etc. very importantly, since only protocols that encode *real* scarcity will ultimately survive, this means *these protocols will do nothing to qualitatively reverse wealth inequality or centralized control*. real wealth and power comes from ownership and control of truly scarce resources, so if these protocols merely encode real scarcity, existing holders of vast resources will remain the most powerful actors in new systems. these protocols will merely make markets more efficient, not reverse the rights abuses that created the status quo. mere markets are not the same thing as true democracy


---

We don't need to subvert or circumvent our governments, we need to fix them.

In closing I'd like to point you towards our efforts to create computing cooperatives in all forms.

Ultimately all of this comes down to actually enforceable ownership and control, which come from communities and systems of justice. Blockchains only have knowledge about computational things, and don't have real jurisdiction over anything. "All real power comes from the barrel of a gun", and blockchains are only capable of keeping a ledger. Actually enforcing that ledger is always going to be a messy human process grounded in the real world. We don't need to subvert or circumvent our governments, we need to fix them.

Creating uncensorable decentralized digital markets can only solve a tiny percentage of our problems. Governments aren't powerful because they control our monetary system, they're powerful because they control land, physical resources, and the loyalty of people. And importantly *that's the point of a government!* We created democratic governments because we recognized our shared need to solve problems and create public goods *in the real world*, ones relating to land and resources that none of us could solve by ourselves. If our governments have become inefficient or corrupt or unfair, then no amount of darknet markets will change that.

There are reasons why blockchains aren't necessary, or could make things worse:



decentralized *identity* is the most important unsolved problem.

there's a theoretical limit of these kinds of semi-cooperative decentralized ledgers, which is one that has zero (marginal) transaction costs, changes state fast enough to be below the threshold of human perception, and is only limited by real computational scarcity. however such a system would completely nullify the two primary incentive systems in the blockchain space (artificially scarce coins that will speculatively rise in value, transaction fees). however such a system *is* possible if the network has a model of "mutual obligation" where each person-linked account is simply expected to do work to secure and audit the ledger, and is exiled if it doesn't meet its obligations or commits fraud. the only way to pay for the development of such a system is with public goods funding, since by its very design it doesn't allow any other funding models. and again, that design achieves a theoretical limit of usefulness! so if we *have* a way of provisioning public goods enough to fund such a thing, then it will inevitably replace and outstrip other models





then the only thing I really want to bring about is an identity-based blockchain that operates through mutual obligation rather than speculative finance incentives, recentering labor rather than assets.

in a mutual obligation network????

- if you create more computational or storage work, you don't necessarily have to *pay* for all that on the network, but you do have to pay for it in your local version and you are the one expected to validate others are replicating it properly.
- or your obligation to others increases. this is ultimately just like a currency?? except that this network obligation can't be transferred?
- oh oh or we simply use democratic weights to allocate obligation at any one time! rather than burning currency we simply prioritize work according to a democratic weighting. if it's possible for an actor or group to do more computation upfront on their own and therefore decrease the amount of work necessary by the network then we can still let people spend physical resources in order to make more complex things happen faster

it's the same as any cooperative good: in order to be a part of the cooperative, you have to provide the same amount of utility to the cooperative, and you get access to the benefits as a cooperative as a result. you have the same right to cooperative goods as everyone else as represented by your democratic weights, and at

is an identity membership chain good enough?
can we just store nothing but current membership and standing and seal snapshots/hashes and nothing else?
