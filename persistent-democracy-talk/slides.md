# Persistent Democracy

## The governmental structure that can fix... everything?

---

# Humanity has some huge problems ahead

---

# Climate Change
<!-- deforestation of rainforests -->
<!-- inefficient  -->

# Resource Scarcity


# Institutional/Market Failure


# Space Governance?

<!-- TODO find headlines -->

- climate change
  - deforestation
  - inability to change policy
  - can't stop harmful consumption
- resource scarcity
  - housing crises around the world
  - essentials like water are being monopolized
  - intellectual property being hoarded
- cultural and institutional failure
  - bad incentives in news and media
  - we have no idea how to govern space
  - social media centralization
  - open source funding
  - income inequality
  - asset inequality
  - political corruption

# I'm convinced
# Persistent Democracy
# can solve all these problems

by making direct democracy and common partial ownership fair and efficient

<!--
could even allow galactic scale civilizations
-->

- solve all those mentioned problems
- make cooperation efficient, maybe even provably optimally
- make direct democracy possible
- allow cooperatives to finally live up to their full potential
- scale society as big as communication and travel allow

# Why doesn't our
# *current* democracy work?

## Democracy =/= Plurality Voting

---

# Plurality Voting
# is awful

<!-- TODO picture of plurality vote -->

<!--
- only thing worse is random chance
- only behaves well when there are exactly two options
 -->

---

# Approval Voting
# is better...

<!-- TODO picture of approval vote -->

---

# ... but not good enough

<!-- TODO picture of two groups, casual and concerned, casual make uninformed choice -->

---

# Resource voting systems
# are much better...

<!-- TODO picture of voter spending different votes on different issues -->

---

# ... but still have important problems

<!-- TODO picture of concerned group going vote broke -->

---

# Persistent Voting

- Resource voting system
- Voters *move around* "weights" instead of *spending* "credits"
- Voters can move around their weights at any time
- Candidates can enter or exit an election at any time
- Current winner is determined by who has the most weights

# Persistent Voting

## Benefits

<v-clicks>

- can vote *merely against* something
- no more election hangovers
- no more strategic windows
- low voter participation not a problem
- direct democracy is reasonable!
- can vote for *documents* instead of people

</v-clicks>

hook by making a big promise about all the problems we could solve

break down why our existing systems suck and how they created our current problems
lots of people think democracy is broken, but what they really mean is our voting system is broken

talk about score voting systems such as approval, and why it isn't perfect, using the example of casual voters who skew results

talk about resource voting systems and quadratic voting, and why they aren't perfect, using the example of "let's do this terrible thing" by a casual majority

explain the basic idea of persistent democracy
instead of "spending" votes, voters "move weights"
voters can move around their weights at any time, rather than having to wait for an election event with a strict deadline

this idea is pretty simple, and those are the only assumptions
I've come up with two specific structures to actually use those weights, persistent voting (used when making reversible decisions), and persistent commitments (used when making irreversible decisions)
explain those, in enough detail to be convincing

this all seems very simple, but it has a few extremely important and surprising benefits
voters don't have to vote *for* something to prevent a bad outcome, they can just use their weights to cast a *negative* vote. (I suspect most casual voters would mostly vote against things they don't find convincing or they expect would harm them in some way)
direct democracy is actually reasonable! since voters have to demonstrate real concern for an issue and
low voter participation is a non-issue!
we can truly hold bad politicians accountable, and quickly remove them from power if they do things we don't like
creative solutions that make everyone happy are incentivized, since having a "voting war" is costly and annoying
it's reasonable to have elections for *documents*, meaning we don't have to delegate all aspects of governance to possibly corruptible people

talk about constitutions

contrast with fluid democracy, point out the serious possible failure modes of fluid democracy

talk about Harberger taxes and why they aren't perfect because everything would be valued only financially. and how persistent democracy fixes that by allowing using weights

talk about quadratic funding and why it isn't perfect because of the pool splitting problem and collusion, and how to fix that using persistent commitments and ratio prioritization

go through a bunch of specific problems and show how they are elegantly solved
while talking about problems of concentrated business power, talk about cooperatives, how they have so much promise but haven't lived up to their potential

how to achieve all this?
here's my plan
foundation to do research and create universal tools
persistently democratic political party
persistently democratic economic cooperative
as part of the economic cooperative, I want to pursue the Magmide project, a programming language intended to make provably correct software the norm

I need help!
I recognize I'm almost certainly not the right person to lead these initiatives as they scale. I'm an engineer, and I want to do innovative engineering, and I don't think I have the temperament for leadership and management


and if I'm asking for help I'm going to share my strengths and weaknesses

this talk is meant to explain what persistent democracy is and how we could make it happen

and hopefully convince you all these huge claims are true!

---

all human prosperity comes from cooperation

almost everything you have or you know comes from cooperating with people both in the present and in the past

ultimately *every* problem we have is just a "sub-problem" of human cooperation

things like governments and religions and companies and clubs and cooperatives are all just structures we've created in order to make cooperation easier

we create these structures with specific rules in order to help us cooperate better, or to cooperate to achieve specific goals

this is the *short* answer to how persistent democracy can solve all of the above problems, because its aim is to solve the coordination problem, once and for all

I have some proof sketches I think are quite convincing that persistent democracy is literally provably optimal (it maximizes welfare for all beings in any universe)

---

let's first take a look at our existing systems for making decisions, starting with our voting systems

the basic way we vote is called Plurality Voting, or "choose one" voting, where each voter

TODO pictures



---

how can we actually achieve all this?

it's very difficult to reform government, even in obvious and uncontroversial ways, let alone new, complex, and unproven ways

first we have to prove persistent democracy works in practice, by experimenting with it in real life. we should do this in very low-stakes ways at first, and then progressively higher stakes as we gain confidence
