# Persistent Democracy

## The governmental structure that can fix... everything?

---

# Humanity has some huge problems ahead

---

# Climate Change
<!-- deforestation of rainforests -->
<!-- inefficient  -->

# Resource Scarcity


# Institutional/Market Failure


# Space Governance?

<!-- TODO find headlines -->

- climate change
  - deforestation
  - inability to change policy
  - can't stop harmful consumption
- resource scarcity
  - housing crises around the world
  - essentials like water are being monopolized
  - intellectual property being hoarded
- cultural and institutional failure
  - bad incentives in news and media
  - we have no idea how to govern space
  - social media centralization
  - open source funding
  - income inequality
  - asset inequality
  - political corruption

# I'm convinced
# Persistent Democracy
# can solve all these problems

by making direct democracy and common partial ownership fair and efficient

<!--
could even allow galactic scale civilizations
-->

- solve all those mentioned problems
- make cooperation efficient, maybe even provably optimally
- make direct democracy possible
- allow cooperatives to finally live up to their full potential
- scale society as big as communication and travel allow

---

# Cooperation is humanity's secret weapon

all human prosperity comes from cooperation

almost everything you have or you know comes from cooperating with people both in the present and in the past

ultimately *every* problem we have is just a "sub-problem" of human cooperation


---

# We use logical systems to cooperate at scale

things like governments and religions and companies and clubs and cooperatives are all just structures we've created in order to make cooperation easier

we create these structures with specific rules in order to help us cooperate better, or to cooperate to achieve specific goals

this is the *short* answer to how persistent democracy can solve all of the above problems, because its aim is to solve the coordination problem, once and for all

I have some proof sketches I think are quite convincing that persistent democracy is literally provably optimal (it maximizes welfare for all beings in any universe)

# Persistent Democracy

- Persistent Voting

# Why doesn't our
# *current* democracy work?

## Democracy =/= Plurality Voting

---

# Plurality Voting is awful

<!-- TODO picture of plurality vote -->

<!--
- only thing worse is random chance
- only behaves well when there are exactly two options
-->

---

# Plurality Voting is awful

## the reason for the broken two party system

- because of vote splitting
- structurally forces parties to merge/die until only two remain

---

# Approval Voting
# is better...

<!-- TODO picture of approval vote -->

# ... but not good enough

<!-- TODO picture of two groups, casual and concerned, casual make uninformed choice -->
<!-- importantly, the casual group isn't wrong or bad or irrational, they did the most rational thing from their perspective. if they slightly prefer some choice and it costs them nothing to support it, then they will -->

# Resource voting systems
# are much better...

<!-- TODO picture of voter spending different votes on different issues -->

---

# ... but still have important problems

<!-- TODO picture of concerned group going vote broke -->

---

# Persistent Voting

- Resource voting system
- Voters *move around* "weights" instead of *spending* "credits"
- Voters can move around their weights at any time
- Candidates can enter or exit an election at any time
- Current winner is determined by who has the most weights

# Persistent Voting

## Stabilization

### Don't change too fast

<!-- TODO picture of update schedule -->

# Persistent Voting

## Stabilization

### Don't change without real support

# Persistent Voting

## Benefits

<v-clicks>

- can vote *merely against* something
- no more election hangovers
- no more strategic windows
- low voter participation not a problem
- direct democracy is reasonable
- can vote for *documents* instead of people

</v-clicks>

# Persistent Democracy

## choosing the Constitution
## using Persistent Voting

although strictly speaking that's all you'd need to do to make persistent democracy, and that constitution can specify literally anything people want, I think there are a few more things we need to do

---

# Persistent Democracy

## flexible districts

<!-- TODO picture highlighting top level districts -->
<!-- TODO picture chopping further -->
<!-- TODO picture chopping further -->

each one of these sub-districts would have its own persistently chosen sub-constitution. these sub-constitutions would intentionally have a narrow scope defined by their ancestor constitutions

# Persistent Commitments

## not all choices are reversible

but we want to avoid the same problems our current systems have with deadlines

---

# Persistent Commitments

## basically just [conviction voting](TODO)

<!-- TODO picture illustrating conviction voting -->

---

# Persistent Prioritization

##

---

# Persistent Budgets

---

# Persistent Funding

---

# Common Partial Ownership

## (common resource taxes)

achieves *highest and best use* for resources

---

# Harberger Taxes

<!-- TODO pictures explaining -->
<!-- someone values something, they state their value -->
<!-- the tax rate is the same for everyone, they pay based on their self-assessed value -->
<!-- but if someone offers to buy for a higher value, the owner *must* sell -->

---

# Harberger Taxes

<v-clicks>

- provably optimal *allocative efficiency*
- removes *market power* and *imperfect information*
- **only values things financially**
- would be a disaster

</v-clicks>

---

# Common Resource Taxes

## Harberger Taxes + Persistent Democracy

<!-- TODO pictures explaining -->
<!-- same as before, but owners can *also* place weights -->
<!-- to force a sale, you have to match both and beat one -->
<!-- and there's also stabilization, your offer has to fill a stabilization bucket -->

---

# Common Resource Taxes

## benefits

<v-clicks>

- things are valued *socially* as well as financially
- more housing
- monopolies are impossible
- makes wealth taxes make more sense

</v-clicks>

---

# Common Resource Taxes

## possible problems?

- only my left shoe was bought: you can "bind together" property
- not everything should be for sale: constitutions can set aside some things
- have to choose between high taxes and voting: probably a good idea to separate "legislative" and "administrative" weights

---

# Common Resource Taxes

## a big change
## start with obvious truly finite things

- land
- domain names
- electromagnetic spectrum
- intellectual property

---

# Common Resource Taxes

it's tempting to think through how this system would work given the current composition of our society
but common resource taxes would prevent the kinds of inequalities that exist in our society today
people wouldn't be fighting for a limited amount of housing, more housing would get built
things like cooperatives would easily out-compete for-profits

---

# A note about taxes in general

we should only tax things that create negative externalities
or otherwise burden society

- common resource taxes (owning something prevents others from owning it)
- wealth taxes (being substantially more wealthy than others is structurally dangerous)
- taxes on harmful/dangerous things

- no income taxes (what counts as income is endlessly manipulable)
- no payroll taxes (working doesn't cause negative externalities)

---

# Could this be provably optimal?

Maybe

I'm making another video giving my step-by-step proof sketch. If it's done the link is in the description, so you can check that out if you care.

---

# Could this be provably optimal?

Harberger taxation is provably optimal with regard to allocative efficiency

quadratic voting is provably optimal in terms of welfare outcome of an election

markets are provably optimal in terms of Pareto efficiency under these circumstances:
- perfect information
- no market power
- no negative externalities

Persistent Democracy is just those things. It's a market that uses Harberger taxation and quadratic voting to auction ownership of *power*, in which all market participants have equal wealth, there is perfect information because prices are public and Harberger taxation provably incentivizes honest valuations, and because all "properties" of pieces of power are always up for auction there can't be any market power or externalities since anyone can step in to change anything if they think it's worth it based on prices.

# How to make this happen?

## huge changes, lots of them very risky

have to prove these ideas in small trials
can't wait for permission

---

# How to make this happen?

- Persistent Democracy Foundation
- Persistently Democratic Political Party
- Persistently Democratic Cooperative

---

# How to make this happen?

## Persistent Democracy Foundation

- find proofs of theoretical claims
- study persistently democratic organizations in practice
- build reusable tools like software and legal documents
- should be controlled using persistent democracy once that's possible

---

# How to make this happen?

## Persistently Democratic Political Party

- can experiment with sub-constitutions for different areas
- do whatever party members wish
- can fund projects and agitate for incremental change

---

# How to make this happen?

## Persistently Democratic Cooperative

- cooperatives are private companies owned by their members (workers or consumers)
- consumer cooperatives are the future given automation (multi-stakeholder in the interim)
- cooperatives are a proven model
- cooperatives haven't lived up to their potential
- can build economic power and change things without getting permission

# I need help!

## I'm an engineer, not a leader or a manager

I want to build things like [Magmide](TODO)
I'd love to do so in the context of an expansive startup-energy cooperative



















I'm convinced Persistent Democracy can solve many of our societal problems, including long-term ones. I need help to make it happen.

A little while ago I came up with Persistent Democracy, a new structure for democratic organization that I am convinced is the most flexible and powerful such a system could possibly be. I have rough proof sketches conjecturing that Persistent Democracy is even provably optimal as a system to allow any being to maximize their welfare.

I'm very passionate about this idea, and have been working on theory and material to share with the world. But I'm realizing the projects will take a while to complete, and many of them aren't very suited to my skills. I've decided I need to get my thoughts and plans out into the world sooner. This post shares the important points, links to various work-in-progress efforts, and details the help I'm looking for.

# Persistent Democracy

[The theory and conjectures is work-in-progress.](TODO)

The only assumptions of Persistent Democracy are that members have some arbitrary number of "decision weights" they can freely move around to effect different decisions, it's directly inspired by [Quadratic Voting]() and [Harberger Taxes](). [This work-in-progress chapter](TODO) discusses in more detail, but here are the big concepts that are unlocked by the paradigm.

## Persistent Voting

Instead of having election events with hard deadlines for everyone to vote and a winner to be selected, Persistent Voting simply allows voters to change their votes at any time, candidates to enter

## Persistent Funding
## Persistent Constitutions

## Persistently Democratic Cooperatives

## Open Source Cooperatives

# My principles, conjectures, and assertions

- [Blockchain technology can be useful in some ways, but it won't solve the social problems many believe it will.](TODO)
- The future must be democratically owned, both economically and politically. Otherwise some kind of horrifying techno-feudalism will emerge. I'm convinced Persistent Democracy and member cooperatives are the best way to structure that ownership.
  - In a world of increasing automation, *worker* ownership will become less important than *consumer/citizen* ownership. Cooperatives should be multi-stakeholder in the meantime.
  -
- [Our current understanding of intellectual property is foolish and inefficient](TODO). It should be replaced with a combination of assurance contracts, open source cooperatives, and Persistent Funding.
  -
- Most


# My plans

All of these plans are merely my best guess at an effective strategy, so I'm completely open to feedback.

I hope to use Persistent Democracy to dramatically reform our politics and economics. These are the institutions I intend to create, and the work they'll do:

- The Persistent Democracy Foundation, a normal non-profit that seeks to advance Persistent Democracy in general. The foundation will use full-time positions and grants to pursue these types of work:
  - Research to validate and deepen the economic and philosophical theory, and empirically study organizations that apply it.
  - Implementation of reusable open source tools to make applying Persistent Democracy easier, such as software, legal toolkits, organizational patterns, etc.
  - Spreading the word through explanatory media and events.
- A persistently democratic political party, intended to prove the viability of Persistent Democracy in a political context and advocate for reform. People will become voting members of the party by either paying yearly dues or doing approved volunteer work.
- A persistently democratic cooperative company, intended to take back control of the economy for normal people. This cooperative won't be constrained to one geographic area or one industry, but is intended to grow to as many corners of the economy as is useful. I want this cooperative to be aggressive and activist and have a "startup energy" rather than settling into a comfortable stasis as many cooperatives have.

Some of these institutions will be easier to create than others. Here are a bunch of "implementation details" for each:

- Foundation:
  - This org will be started first, since it will create tools necessary to start the other two.
  - This is structured as a non-profit to make things simpler for funders, but the institution should be controlled using Persistent Democracy once that's possible.
- Political Party:
  - By using a Persistent Constitution, the party will be able to pursue whatever political goals members wish in whatever way they wish. Since these members joined a persistently democratic party, its very likely those goals will in some way advocate for Persistent Democracy or similar reforms.
  - The party will start in the US, but could become a global institution with chapters in different polities.
  - Starting this party should be relatively straightforward, since it won't in any way strain US regulatory boundaries.
- Cooperative:
  - There are a *ton* of tricky legal/regulatory questions to answer in regard to this cooperative. I'd like its first facet to be a digital credit union, but because of the fairly tight regulatory boundaries around credit unions it's unclear if that's possible. Regardless, I'm more interested in creating a powerful and dynamic organization than fitting nicely into existing frameworks, so this institution will be structured in whatever way is necessary to achieve its goals. If that's as a "for-profit" entity whose charter demands it use Persistent Democracy, then that's what I'll do.
  - Since I'm an engineer this cooperative will have a heavy focus on software innovation and automation from the very beginning. I strongly believe the [Magmide proof language project](TODO) would dramatically improve the quality and security of our software infrastructure, so I hope to incubate that project in this cooperative. I intend for Magmide to be the foundation of many other software projects, such as low-code programming languages, databases, operating systems, etc.
  - I might experiment with the [proof of social trust decentralized consensus mechanism](TODO) in the context of this cooperative.
  - Different parts of the cooperative where usage between members can be drastically different might use concepts of [User-Defined Organizations](TODO).

# How I need help

I'm a computer engineer and logician, so much of the way I intend to contribute to the above work is through engineering and formal verification. But there are a ton of other necessary skills. Specifically the most important immediate needs are:

- A lawyer: someone who can navigate the tricky legal and organizational questions, especially those surrounding

But above all, I'm looking for funding. I've been working on all this writing and theory in my free time, but it's going much slower than I'd like. I'd be thrilled to talk to funders interested in new voting and coordination methods and who see the potential in Persistent Democracy. If someone appears who's excited to offer funding, then I'll put the task to incorporate the Persistent Democracy Foundation at the top of my list.

I'm going to make all of this happen, it's just a question of how long it will take. I've decided I'm done asking for permission, but I am asking for help.

And finally, in the spirit of transparency, I'm just going to share my strengths and weaknesses with the fullest amount of brutal honesty I can. I think I'm capable of leading this effort in the beginning, but I recognize my flaws, and am sure that at some point I'll be much more suited to a non-leadership role. I'm most comfortable and productive wrangling interesting engineering or logical problems, so I expect if this all goes to plan my final place among these institutions would be as an engineer in the economic cooperative.

## My weaknesses

I'm a father, so time constrained
I'm a night owl. This is a weakness, as much as I'd like to believe otherwise.
My personal life isn't in order, so I fall into bouts of depression and loneliness and craving status

## My strengths
I'm an extremely skilled programmer and engineer. I'm very excited to do work regarding formal verification and bring that into the mainstream.
I'm extraordinarily focused. I'm able to complete immense amounts of difficult work very quickly, *once I'm convinced a project is worth the time*.
I'm very creative, especially when solving tricky open-ended problems. I point to things like Magmide and Persistent Democracy to validate that assertion.
I have a good sense of "engineering design", meaning
I can be a good teacher and explainer.
