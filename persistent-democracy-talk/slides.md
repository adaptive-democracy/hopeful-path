# I'm convinced<br>Persistent Democracy<br>can solve these problems

- make cooperation efficient, maybe provably optimally
- make direct democracy possible
- efficiently negotiate ownership of all resources
- allow cooperatives to finally live up to their full potential
- scale democratic society as big as communication and travel allow

---

# Cooperation<br>is humanity's<br>secret weapon

- all human prosperity comes from cooperation
- sharing and passing down knowledge is a form of cooperation
- even small groups rely on cooperation to survive and thrive
- almost all problems are versions of cooperation failure

- still have to be validated in the real world of course

# Persistent Voting

- resource voting system
- voters *move around* "weights" instead of *spending* "credits"
- voters can move around their weights at any time
- candidates can enter or exit an election at any time
- current winner is determined by who has the most weights

---

## Persistent Voting

##### Update Schedule

it would be stressful for vote changes to be published and possibly change the result the moment they happen

## Persistent Voting

##### Benefits

<v-clicks>

- can vote *merely against* something
- no more election hangovers
- no more last minute trickery
- low voter participation not a problem
- direct democracy is reasonable
- can vote for *documents* instead of people

## Persistent Constitutions

- constitutions can structure things however people want
- can delegate more or less control to officials
- can give special extra weights to elected experts
- can combine methods like sortition, approval voting, etc

---

## Persistent Commitments

##### not all choices are reversible

- budgets
- public projects
- court cases
- administrative restructuring

##### need to avoid deadline problems

---

## Persistent Commitments

##### basically just [Conviction Voting](https://miro.medium.com/max/1220/1*NTN1FVV6VpoxY1lR8ENY1w.jpeg)

##### gives more money to projects with more small donors

## Quadratic Funding

##### problems when:

- matching pool isn't big enough
- lots of spammy projects

---

## Persistent Funding

- uses persistent commitments rounds
- voters select a decision document
- can remove spammy projects
- can choose to fund nothing
- can add extra money to the funding pool

## Persistent Funding

can prioritize projects that achieve the most social good (have the most weight)<br>compared to how much they would cost to match

# Common Partial Ownership

- the way we think about property ownership isn't the most efficient or the most ethical
- we've enshrined the "dibs" rule as a sacred right
- non-negotiable property makes big and small monopolies easy
- strengthens cycles of cumulative advantage
- but we have no idea how to manually redistribute property...

<v-clicks>

- things are valued *socially* as well as financially
- more housing

- makes wealth taxes make more sense

</v-clicks>

---

## Common Resource Taxes

##### possible problems?

- only my left shoe was bought: you can "bind together" property
- national parks shouldn't be for sale: constitutions can set aside some things
- have to choose between high taxes and voting: probably a good idea to separate "legislative" and "administrative" weights

---

## Common Resource Taxes

##### a big change
##### start with obvious truly finite things

- land
- domain names
- electromagnetic spectrum
- intellectual property

---

## Common Resource Taxes

#### would still dramatically change society

- billionaires wouldn't just buy everything
- it's likely billionaires couldn't exist anymore
- people wouldn't fight over housing, more would get built
- cooperatives would easily out-compete for-profits

---

## A note about taxes in general

##### we should only tax things that create negative externalities<br>or otherwise burden society

- common resource taxes (owning something prevents others from owning it)
- wealth taxes (being substantially more wealthy than others is structurally dangerous)
- taxes on harmful/dangerous things

- no income taxes (what counts as income is endlessly manipulable)
- no payroll taxes (working doesn't cause negative externalities)

---

## Could this be provably optimal?

##### maybe!

proof sketch presentation is work-in-progress

```
persistent voting
==
Harberger auction for ownership of decision making power

common partial ownership
+ persistent voting
==
Pareto efficient market for ownership of society
```

<!-- Harberger taxation is provably optimal with regard to allocative efficiency

quadratic voting is provably optimal in terms of welfare outcome of an election

markets are provably optimal in terms of Pareto efficiency under these circumstances:
- perfect information
- no market power
- no negative externalities

Persistent Democracy is just those things. It's a market that uses Harberger taxation and quadratic voting to auction ownership of *power*, in which all market participants have equal wealth, there is perfect information because prices are public and Harberger taxation provably incentivizes honest valuations, and because all "properties" of pieces of power are always up for auction there can't be any market power or externalities since anyone can step in to change anything if they think it's worth it based on prices. -->

## Could this be provably optimal?

##### even if it *does* turn out to be provably optimal...

##### ... we still have to validate it in real applications

##### proof sketch is convincing enough for me to work on applications

## Comparison with Liquid Democracy

liquid democracy allows delegating votes

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/560/1*7_LuI-hO6J5Jdz6HIK3R4Q.png)

---

## Comparison with Liquid Democracy

- would make "automated demagoguery" <br>worryingly possible

- don't need explicit delegation, Persistent Voting has<br>"delegation by abstention"

---

## How to make this happen?

##### huge changes, lots of them risky

- have to validate in low-risk contexts
- can't wait for permission

---

## How to make this happen?

#### here's my plan:

- Persistent Democracy Labs (general support)
- Persistently Democratic Political Party (political activism)
- Persistently Democratic Cooperative (economic activism)

---

## How to make this happen?

#### Persistent Democracy Labs

- evolve and prove theoretical claims
- resolve open questions (anti-noise nomination method?)
- study persistently democratic organizations in practice
- build reusable tools like software and legal documents
- should be controlled using persistent democracy once possible

---

## How to make this happen?

#### Persistently Democratic Political Party

- members pay dues and therefore get voting weights
- members select the constitution at all levels
- easier to get going than a cooperative
- can experiment with sub-constitutions for different areas
- can fund projects and agitate for incremental change

---

## How to make this happen?

#### Persistently Democratic Cooperative

<v-clicks>

##### Cooperative?

- cooperatives are private companies owned by their members<br>(workers or consumers)
- consumer cooperatives are the future given automation<br>(multi-stakeholder in the interim)
- cooperatives are a proven model
- cooperatives haven't lived up to their potential

</v-clicks>

---

## How to make this happen?

#### Persistently Democratic Cooperative

<v-clicks>

##### this is where we can really change things

- can build economic power without waiting for permission or reform
- can afford to fail
- can we build a mega-cooperative?
- can we reclaim science, technology, and industrial scale?

</v-clicks>

<!--
I'm convinced Persistent Democracy can solve many of our societal problems, including long-term ones. I need help to make it happen.

A little while ago I came up with Persistent Democracy, a new structure for democratic organization that I am convinced is the most flexible and powerful such a system could possibly be. I have rough proof sketches conjecturing that Persistent Democracy is even provably optimal as a system to allow any being to maximize their welfare.

I'm very passionate about this idea, and have been working on theory and material to share with the world. But I'm realizing the projects will take a while to complete, and many of them aren't very suited to my skills. I've decided I need to get my thoughts and plans out into the world sooner. This post shares the important points, links to various work-in-progress efforts, and details the help I'm looking for.

# Persistent Democracy

[The theory and conjectures is work-in-progress.](TODO)

The only assumptions of Persistent Democracy are that members have some arbitrary number of "decision weights" they can freely move around to effect different decisions, it's directly inspired by [Quadratic Voting]() and [Harberger Taxes](). [This work-in-progress chapter](TODO) discusses in more detail, but here are the big concepts that are unlocked by the paradigm.

## Persistent Voting

Instead of having election events with hard deadlines for everyone to vote and a winner to be selected, Persistent Voting simply allows voters to change their votes at any time, candidates to enter

## Persistent Funding
## Persistent Constitutions

## Persistently Democratic Cooperatives

## Open Source Cooperatives

# My principles, conjectures, and assertions

- [Blockchain technology can be useful in some ways, but it won't solve the social problems many believe it will.](TODO)
- The future must be democratically owned, both economically and politically. Otherwise some kind of horrifying techno-feudalism will emerge. I'm convinced Persistent Democracy and member cooperatives are the best way to structure that ownership.
  - In a world of increasing automation, *worker* ownership will become less important than *consumer/citizen* ownership. Cooperatives should be multi-stakeholder in the meantime.
  -
- [Our current understanding of intellectual property is foolish and inefficient](TODO). It should be replaced with a combination of assurance contracts, open source cooperatives, and Persistent Funding.
  -
- Most


# My plans

All of these plans are merely my best guess at an effective strategy, so I'm completely open to feedback.

I hope to use Persistent Democracy to dramatically reform our politics and economics. These are the institutions I intend to create, and the work they'll do:

- The Persistent Democracy Foundation, a normal non-profit that seeks to advance Persistent Democracy in general. The foundation will use full-time positions and grants to pursue these types of work:
  - Research to validate and deepen the economic and philosophical theory, and empirically study organizations that apply it.
  - Implementation of reusable open source tools to make applying Persistent Democracy easier, such as software, legal toolkits, organizational patterns, etc.
  - Spreading the word through explanatory media and events.
- A persistently democratic political party, intended to prove the viability of Persistent Democracy in a political context and advocate for reform. People will become voting members of the party by either paying yearly dues or doing approved volunteer work.
- A persistently democratic cooperative company, intended to take back control of the economy for normal people. This cooperative won't be constrained to one geographic area or one industry, but is intended to grow to as many corners of the economy as is useful. I want this cooperative to be aggressive and activist and have a "startup energy" rather than settling into a comfortable stasis as many cooperatives have.

Some of these institutions will be easier to create than others. Here are a bunch of "implementation details" for each:

- Foundation:
  - This org will be started first, since it will create tools necessary to start the other two.
  - This is structured as a non-profit to make things simpler for funders, but the institution should be controlled using Persistent Democracy once that's possible.
- Political Party:
  - By using a Persistent Constitution, the party will be able to pursue whatever political goals members wish in whatever way they wish. Since these members joined a persistently democratic party, its very likely those goals will in some way advocate for Persistent Democracy or similar reforms.
  - The party will start in the US, but could become a global institution with chapters in different polities.
  - Starting this party should be relatively straightforward, since it won't in any way strain US regulatory boundaries.
- Cooperative:
  - There are a *ton* of tricky legal/regulatory questions to answer in regard to this cooperative. I'd like its first facet to be a digital credit union, but because of the fairly tight regulatory boundaries around credit unions it's unclear if that's possible. Regardless, I'm more interested in creating a powerful and dynamic organization than fitting nicely into existing frameworks, so this institution will be structured in whatever way is necessary to achieve its goals. If that's as a "for-profit" entity whose charter demands it use Persistent Democracy, then that's what I'll do.
  - Since I'm an engineer this cooperative will have a heavy focus on software innovation and automation from the very beginning. I strongly believe the [Magmide proof language project](TODO) would dramatically improve the quality and security of our software infrastructure, so I hope to incubate that project in this cooperative. I intend for Magmide to be the foundation of many other software projects, such as low-code programming languages, databases, operating systems, etc.
  - I might experiment with the [proof of social trust decentralized consensus mechanism](TODO) in the context of this cooperative.
  - Different parts of the cooperative where usage between members can be drastically different might use concepts of [User-Defined Organizations](TODO).

# How I need help

I'm a computer engineer and logician, so much of the way I intend to contribute to the above work is through engineering and formal verification. But there are a ton of other necessary skills. Specifically the most important immediate needs are:

- A lawyer: someone who can navigate the tricky legal and organizational questions, especially those surrounding

But above all, I'm looking for funding. I've been working on all this writing and theory in my free time, but it's going much slower than I'd like. I'd be thrilled to talk to funders interested in new voting and coordination methods and who see the potential in Persistent Democracy. If someone appears who's excited to offer funding, then I'll put the task to incorporate the Persistent Democracy Foundation at the top of my list.

I'm going to make all of this happen, it's just a question of how long it will take. I've decided I'm done asking for permission, but I am asking for help.

And finally, in the spirit of transparency, I'm just going to share my strengths and weaknesses with the fullest amount of brutal honesty I can. I think I'm capable of leading this effort in the beginning, but I recognize my flaws, and am sure that at some point I'll be much more suited to a non-leadership role. I'm most comfortable and productive wrangling interesting engineering or logical problems, so I expect if this all goes to plan my final place among these institutions would be as an engineer in the economic cooperative.

## My weaknesses

I'm a father, so time constrained
I'm a night owl. This is a weakness, as much as I'd like to believe otherwise.
My personal life isn't in order, so I fall into bouts of depression and loneliness and craving status

## My strengths
I'm an extremely skilled programmer and engineer. I'm very excited to do work regarding formal verification and bring that into the mainstream.
I'm extraordinarily focused. I'm able to complete immense amounts of difficult work very quickly, *once I'm convinced a project is worth the time*.
I'm very creative, especially when solving tricky open-ended problems. I point to things like Magmide and Persistent Democracy to validate that assertion.
I have a good sense of "engineering design", meaning
I can be a good teacher and explainer.
