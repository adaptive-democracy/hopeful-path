# classic definition is controversial

nothing is truly *non*-excludable, just impractically expensive to exclude

rivalry/exclusion are continuous dimensions rather than simple categories

useful concepts, but I'm more interested in a more general category

---

# cooperative goods

happen when people combine contributions into a single good and share its benefits

individually their contributions would be worthless

tend to have "thresholds" of usefulness

---

# swimming pools

- real pools are expensive
- also *awesome*, especially in hot climates
- easy to share
- cost can be divided many ways

---

## each person gets more benefit than cost *because of sharing*

## most public goods are also cooperative goods:
<!-- in the sense that they *have* to be shared in order to be worth the cost -->

- municipal water systems
- public parks
- community defense
- environmental protection

---

## many public goods are *only* valuable when shared

- roads
- communications networks
- protocols of all kinds (flight protocols, network protocols)
- languages

---

## some *can't* be made into club goods:
<!-- because exclusion can't possibly be done by anything other than a government with a military -->

- national parks
- environmental protection

---

## others *shouldn't* be made into club goods:
<!-- because there's inherent moral or societal value in giving everyone access -->

- roads
- public education
- public parks
- open source software
- healthcare (hot take!!)

# we don't create enough cooperative goods!

our society could usefully fit a lot more

would create immense prosperity and welfare for everyone in society

are all missed opportunities!

---

# why not?

its hard to coordinate the funding and control of cooperative goods

[but it doesn't have to be!](/adaptive-funding)
