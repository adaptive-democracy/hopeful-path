# Political Activism, and the Path To a Global Persistently Democratic Political Party

There are innumerable things we have to fix about our government and our laws. Rather than try to batter our beliefs into an existing political party's platform or create a new party with a specific platform and try to convince you that platform is the right one, why not just make the political party *itself* democratically controlled? If the only core idea of a party is persistent democratic control then it will be able to guide itself to the wishes of its members.
it's not good enough to just fight economically in the private sphere, we have to change our government. the cooperative and this political party are intentionally designed to reinforce the efforts of the other as we push for total societal reform.

of course it might be nice to start with something.

here are a few big ideas that would dramatically change our society for the better. many of them are mathematically verified, and my hope is that each of them will be convincing enough to make it into the platform

first just ballot initatives to get approval voting into as many polities as possible. approval voting isn't perfect, but its a pragmatic first step we can use as a foothold for bigger changes.

now some more far out ideas, ones I hope inspire you about what's really possible, and help you realize how unfair and inefficient our existing systems are





## Democratic Districts

we already talked about how persistent constitutions can be nested, which means that we can nest them according to persistently chosen district maps. the lines of our political entities don't really make any sense, and don't actually put together groups of people who have shared problems they need to coordinate to solve. dividing administrative areas makes sense, since it allows us to delegate responsibility and makes sure that governance gets more contextually aware as it gets more specific.
congressional districts don't make sense, and partially that's just a problem we could solve with normal persistent democracy since we should just have something better than our congress. but if we are going to have districts in any situation, they ought to at least roughly track the boundaries of real communities, as decided by those communities.

## Abolishing Intellectual Property

having property rules for physical stuff makes sense (even if we should structure them differently), because physical stuff is rivalrous. if I have an apple, you can't also have that exact apple without splitting it in half and both of us getting less than we would by ourselves. we need ways to negotiate the splitting and sharing and giving.
intellectual property is inherently a fiction, because it isn't rivalrous, it isn't scarce. the labor that produces it is, but the thing itself doesn't even exist, it's just patterns, codes we can decipher or build machines to decipher. it makes sense to have the right to be recognized as the creator of a work, because doing so is simply acknowledging reality and preventing fraud, but owning intellectual property means you have the right to stop the actions of people who might have never ever heard of you, just because they're doing the same patterns as you.
metaphor: if I can somehow patent the idea of waving my hand in a particular shape, then people who accidentally wave their hand are violating the law? how ridiculous is that?

intellectual property law seems to tacitly acknowledge this, because there's an arbitrary limit on length of ownership. the law admits that ultimately the only reason we're allowing someone to control an intellectual work is because we eventually want it to pass into the public domain. my claim is that the intellectual property paradigm is a completely stupid way to do this.
we've already talked about quadratic funding and how it can be used in a persistently democratic way. using assurance contracts and a more rigorous form of crowdfunding we can apply persistent funding to intellectual labor

### Democratic Prizes (already finished work)

someone's already completed something in private
they submit a description of what they've done, and make promises about its content. they also set a price
they convince people to pledge to it with money and weights
when its funded, its revealed and made public domain. there's a waiting period before the money changes hands where the funders can allege it's fraudulent

works for profit seeking entities, those with capital to get them through the process of doing the work

### Democratic Grants (proposed future work)

someone has an idea for specific work to do
they submit a description, and a timesliced budget with milestones. they also choose a reward amount they get at the end for success
they convince people to pledge to it with money and weights
when its funded, the money is released timeslice by timeslice, and the funders can vote in a commitment every cycle whether to continue to the next cycle. if the project is canceled the remaining money is refunded.
if the project is successful the creators get the final reward
if they go overschedule they eat into the reward amount until it's gone. if the money runs out then they have to pitch a new continuation project

the original proposals for ideas can of course come from the public rather than creators.

## Wealth Taxes

Let's imagine a society with one extremely wealthy person, and a bunch of poor people. Let's say the government in this society fully enforces a naive idea of property rights. Let's say this society is democratic, even persistently democratic, but its constitution prevents taxes from taking an unequal percentage of wealth from any member.
It's pretty obvious the extremely wealthy person will be the dictator of this society, regardless of the democratic structure. If a very wealthy person can pay most of society 3x their yearly income every year for as long as they keep doing whatever the wealthy person says, then whatever they want will happen. Even if people get tired of them, it will be easy for that person to just buy out enough of the group or the collaborators of the group, so their strength won't be enough to actually do anything.
An even simpler statement: how many people with guns, or people operating the justice system, can this person buy off?

We're also assuming that if someone was really able to accrue that much wealth, it wasn't because they really made that massive a marginal contribution to society. They did it by leveraging some vulnerability in our systems of ownership that allowed them to exert undue leverage over others. A tax like this is the failsafe mechanism, something that will always kick in and correct things if we don't happen to catch something at a lower level.

a bunch of our tax designs suck, partially because they're regressive and unfair, but mostly because they're so easy to evade. income taxes are particularly really stupid. obviously because of the capital gains loophole, but also just because making an income isn't an inherently externality producing event. making income doesn't impose any burden on society.


The idea is to structure a continuous S curve function such that the inflection point in the curve represents a safe level of wealth, an amount that doesn't give the owner enough social power to distort markets or institutions, because they don't have enough marginal leverage over others.
we want the curve to reshape according to the inequality and purchasing power, or the amount of latent marginal leverage, in the society. so if a society has corrected and is healthy, then wealth taxes aren't as much of a thing
if someone makes $10,000, and someone offers them a bribe of $50,000, then the offerer kinda owns this person now. they're offering to move them from crippling poverty to merely laborious poverty. in contrast if someone makes $100,000 and they're offered a bribeof $50,000, then that's attractive sure, but that person can much more easily say "eh, I'm good" if there's something unsavory or troubling about the offer. it is more likely they're more worried about social standing or other intangible things than the person with $10,000
the presence of extremely desperate people alongside extremely wealthy people is literally dangerous for everyone.

I'm not sure what math makes this all make sense, I'm more proposing an interesting set of principles and a design challenge








and of course, wouldn't it be nice just to merge with an existing party instead of making a new one! of course, the requirement of a completely persistently democratic structure is a hard line we shouldn't be willing to cross, so any organization we merge with would have to take up that idea
in terms of membership structure, it seems simple, because any cooperative must ask its members to support the cooperative in some way, members either pay some set membership dues or do some kind of volunteering. these two things could be compensated using the [user defined organization](TODO) mechanism, where paying membership dues or performing volunteer hours grants decaying weights. there should be a limit to the maximum monthly dues, if we're going to try to court larger donations the benefits should only be intangible and social in nature. the constitutional kernel can define a maximum monthly donation and set a hardcoded hourly amount of weights for volunteering.
members gain voting rights, and can come to member meetings and gatherings.

there are lots of decisions to make, and I don't think the best way for them to be figured out is for me to sit alone and try to figure them all out.

- a simplified tax system, with democratically counterbalanced harberger taxes at the center, and then democratically chosen externality taxes on anything that fell into an "interfering" area of rights. also, with the democratically counterbalanced harberger taxes allowing some kind of "lockin" mechanism that enables some land to be semi-permanently protected, representing the reality that the destruction/exploitation of most natural treasures would be inherenly irreversible and so the legal mechanism that protects them should be as well.
  by allowing democratic weights to be used to offset harberger taxes, or to inflation fund democratic projects, we've essentially created a way for economic value to exchange with all other forms of social utility. that's essential, since the biggest potential problem with harberger taxes is that they only account for economic utility and discard all others.

- bottom up self associating administrative districts, or holistic districts

- a democratically controlled monetary system, wherein the same weights used in elections and the harberger tax can be used to produce inflation funding, but as time goes on the inflation gets more expensive. the system's default state is 0% inflation

- refer to theories of rights and the "fair exchange" idea from above.

- abolishing intellectual property with the crowdsell mechanism and quadratic funding. intellectual *labor* instead. intellectual property isn't like normal property, because its *intrinsic utility* (although *maybe* not its market price utility) actually *increases* with its increased social use (generally). this means that our current property-based regimes are inherently fictional and inefficient, and only really exist to enable capitalistic extraction. intellectual property is probably the chief enabler of current inequality, because it's entirely arbitrary and absolute. someone can own *an idea* and use that as an immense leverage point to extract wealth from society. also, investigating how the crowdsell mechanism would interact with just normal publicly (quadratically) funded research. also, investigating how it would change the stucture of the economy, and lend itself greatly to much much smaller profit-seeking innovation companies (which are perfectly suited to thrive in a fluid university described below) alongside larger member cooperative administrative companies.

- using these ideas of efficient democratic ownership as the basis of a universal basic income. essentially what we've done is instead of merely bolstering labor in the fight between labor and capital, we've *subsumed* capital *by* labor. we can create a society where everyone is part of the ownership class and benefits from the passive income. this is especially crucial (and more possible!) because of the portent of automation. if we don't create a society of democratic ownership, inequality will produce either a crushing techo-feudalism, or a terrifying eradication scenario.

- it's possible for people to use their democratic weights to gain increased access to collective resources. Since we're already using them as a means of mediating access to influence and land, it makes sense to do so with things like healthcare or other kinds of resources. The goal in such a system then is to raise the floor of guaranteed access by increasing budgets or merely investing in innovation.

- decentralizing justice and policing, by having "justice tribes" that represent everyone and bring grievances against other tribes, with some randomly selected panel of other outside justice tribes acting as mediators/arbiters. also, restorative justice?

- decentralizing the military and public defense, through some similar mechanism as above, with some kind of coming-of-age ritual military service thing that intentionally gets people out of their communities into far-away places to serve them, and is focused on producing compassionate and learned warrior "monks" rather than brainwashing people into being a mindless cog in the military machine.

- a better version of esperanto, and having the whole world fully embrace a global trade language.

What if I told you there was a way we could almost entirely solve the problems of corporate consolidation, capitalist malfeasance, plutocratic poltical and cultural manipulation, income inequality, consumerism, and environmental degradation? What if I told you that could all be done with just one kind of activist effort which has been repeatedly validated as effective, robust, self-sustaining, and requires no political reform, policy change, government intervention, or social consensus?

If you're being properly skeptical, you would tell me I'd better have a way to explain why, if this tactic is so excellent, it hasn't already been used, and what has recently changed to make it actually viable.

And




I've often found myself searching for a solution to some important set of problems, and discovered a solution that at first seemed to create a completely perfect match, only to realize with agony it had some absolutely critical flaw I couldn't overcome. This was almost the case when fitting member cooperatives to our shared economic and cultural woes, the critical flaw being a reliance on the same slow, unfair, inexpressive, and inefficient democratic systems that make government so ramshackle.

Economic inequality is a growing concern in our society, and is spurred by corporate consolidation. Large corporations use their market influence and vast resources to crush or acquire competitors, and manipulate politics and culture to fit their ends. A large amount of consumer surplus is hoarded by these corporations, as they increasingly discover and leverage weaknesses in human psychology to trick their customers into paying higher prices or buying harmful or unnecessary products. Our society must address these imbalances, but it is difficult and often impractical to do so with government.

## Description

Member cooperatives are a powerful model of economic organization that combines all the best aspects of for-profit companies, non-profit charities, and democratic institutions. In a member cooperative, members democratically own and control a private organization that exists solely to meet the common goals of the group. They grant groups the ability to organize to solve their own economic problems, without relying on the inherently adversarial profit motive. And in the form of Credit Unions, the viability of the model has already been proven.

However, since member cooperatives have traditionally relied on the same slow and inefficient methods of democratic control used by governments, they haven't reached anything close to their full potential. By using Persistent Democracy, member cooperatives can be controlled in an extremely nimble and fair manner, allowing them to inspire confidence and compete with profit-seeking companies.

Member cooperatives need some way to distinguish voting members from everyone else, and must require that members contribute in some way to the cooperative. This means they work best when the customer relationship is ongoing and predictable. Any business model based on subscriptions or membership fees can be trivially made into a cooperative, and as the recent direct-to-consumer subscription service trend demonstrates, many more products and services can be delivered as subscriptions or memberships than was previously appreciated.

The industries we should most prefer to start cooperatives in are those where risk is well quantified and market value is obvious, as is the case in any commodity industry. Almost all industries that currently form the bedrock of our economy could be operated as member cooperatives:

- Banking, finance, and real estate services.
- Insurance.
- Healthcare.
- Food production.
- News media.
- General retail.
- Utilities and energy.
- Internet and telecommunications.
- Commodity goods manufacturing.
- Cloud computing services.
- Online marketplaces.

Activists seeking to address economic inequality, poor public health, environmental degradation, or cultural manipulation have been frequently frustrated in trying to institute legal solutions to these problems. Many will of course still require legal changes, and we shouldn't tolerate our political systems being so inefficient and unresponsive. But even if the structural reforms discussed in this book were implemented and used to agitate for other reforms, democracy still requires something resembling consensus. An efficient and fair democracy won't be enough to solve all these issues, and we'll still meet resistance and frustration when pursuing goals that seem obvious to us. To deal with this reality, I propose a new kind of activism, Economic Activism.

Member cooperatives can be started by anyone at anytime, with no need for special permission or legal reforms. They simply must follow the law and remain solvent. Anyone with passion for some change that would require businesses to act differently can immediately begin working to make that change by creating a cooperative. Cooperatives don't in any way extract profits to an owner class and can instead reinvest profits to lower prices or improve service, and they can quickly hold managers accountable through democratic control. These qualities mean cooperatives always have the potential to maximize consumer surplus and increase members' prosperity more than a for-profit company. If a cooperative can create more prosperity for members, then it will inevitably overtake and destroy any abusive for-profit competitors, taking away the economic capability that forms the foundation of plutocratic power.

It has been relatively easy for the wealthy to prevent social change by hampering politics. But in order to stop cooperatives from overtaking their companies they would have to hamper the very markets they themselves operate in, a more delicate task.

We don't have to wait for the goverment's permission to attack economic inequality and consumerism. Through cooperative Economic Activism, we can attack the source of those problems directly and immediately. We can seize the economic power that has for so long been used against us.

## Benefits

- Member cooperatives aren't controlled by profit-seeking shareholders and are only constrained by the need to remain fiscally solvent. This means they can prioritize members' non-monetary values and pursue any initiative regardless of whether it fully maximizes profits.
- Cooperatives have no need to leverage artificial scarcity, monopoly, planned obsolescence, or psychological weaknesses to manipulate markets and their customers. As long as they remain solvent, they can adopt whatever business model their members feel provides them greatest prosperity.
- Consumerism and environmental degradation have been spurred largely by the one-sided incentive to maximize profits, since more consumption always leads to more profits regardless of market oversaturation. Member cooperatives have no incentive to oversaturate markets.
- Member cooperatives are still constrained by market dynamics and fiscal solvency, meaning they are allowed to evolve or die or merge just as companies are. This stands in contrast with government agencies which sometimes are allowed to become inefficient or stagnant without sufficient accountability.
- Member cooperatives give control over the means of production to citizens and can prevent the rise of "techo-feudalism", as automation and artificial intelligence decrease the value of human labor.

## Potential Objections

- Member cooperatives don't automatically grant any special rights to employees, and still allow for the same adversarial relationship between member-owners and labor. This worry is mitigated by these considerations:
  - Automation will make this less and less acute over time, and gradually cooperatives will mostly control land and machinery with very little human labor.
  - Cooperatives can choose to automatically grant their employees equal or special voting rights.
  - Cooperatives are still subject to labor regulations.
- Member cooperatives are controlled democratically and are therefore steered by their members' values, which might still be selfish or biased or irrational. However those same negative values would still otherwise have been expressed in the market as buying decisions, so a democratic arrangement is likely to be a strict improvement.
- Cooperatives aren't a panacea, and can't solve all our societal problems. Poltical activism and reform are still absolutely necessary.

## Open Questions

- Would it make sense to propose reforms that alter the tax obligations or anti-trust limitations of cooperatives if they met some criteria of democratic control? Monopoly could be a non-issue with cooperatives since they by definition allow membership to anyone who can contribute, but the requirements for contribution could potentially be abused. However especially with the inherently anti-monopoly effects of common resource taxes, it might be reasonable to simply remove anti-trust regulations entirely and be confident that abusive companies will always be overtaken by cooperatives.
- What precise governance structure should our ideal cooperative have? I intend at some point in the future to draft a constitution and start a cooperative myself. I'm very excited about this idea, and have many specific ideas about governance and business models.
