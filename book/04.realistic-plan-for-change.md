title: "A Realistic Plan for Fundamental Change"

The best systems and ideas mean nothing if we can't use them to actually change the world around us.

Persistent Democracy has immense potential to improve our society:

- Using Persistent Voting and Constitutions as a foundation, it's possible for us to control every aspect of a democratic institution with arbitrary flexibility and accountability.
- Voters can provide as much information to the system as they wish in elections, but [fluidly balanced nomination systems](/quadratic-range-voting) will prevent elections from becoming noisy and unproductive.
- Systems such as [Persistent Funding](/persistent-funding) and [assurance contracts](/intellectual-property-and-assurance-contracts) can allow us to flexibly fund arbitrary [public goods](/cooperative-goods).
- [Common Resource Rights](/common-resource-rights) can allow us to maximize the social benefit achieved by all resources and property, and ensure monopolies and cycles of cumulative advantage are structurally impossible.

Sounds pretty good to me!

**But can we actually achieve any of this in practice?** Many of these systems would require an almost complete rewrite of our political institutions. Our governmental systems are extremely important, and accidentally breaking them can have devastating consequences. As much confidence as we may have in these ideas, it would be extraordinarily risky to try to move to them in one fell swoop.

We have no choice but to first *validate* these systems in low-risk contexts, and then build them up incrementally as we gain confidence in their details and our ability to implement them efficiently. Over time we can apply them in more and more important and impactful institutions.

Of course, it would be nice if our experimental validations could also do some real good! If it's possible for our low-risk applications to actually provide immediate benefit, that would be great.

This chapter presents a plan I believe can incrementally achieve these goals by creating three progressively more ambitious institutions.

## Persistent Democracy Labs

Persistent Democracy Labs will be a nonprofit focused on building general tools and infrastructure to enable the implementation of Persistent Democracy. It will be governed as funded as an [open source project cooperative](/open-source-project-cooperatives), allowing concerned people to become funding members and therefore exercise voting control.

The work done by Persistent Democracy Labs is necessary before any other efforts can successfully and truly implement Persistent Democracy, since book-keeping systems like Persistent Voting and Funding would be onerous and error-prone if done without specialized software.

We'll need other things than software. Persistently democratic organizations will have to navigate existing legal constraints regarding institutional ownership and taxation, so Persistent Democracy Labs should also produce things like open source articles of incorporation and other legal documents. It should also support general research to improve the economic and ethical theory, invent new specific systems, and empirically study persistently democratic organizations and elections as they occur in the real world.

As it reaches maturity and we grow confident in Persistent Democracy, Persistent Democracy Labs should also begin producing persuasive essays and other media. As it begins working for us, we should share it with others!

This detail chapter describes what work Persistent Democracy Labs will do and how it will be structured:

## Persistently Democratic political party

Political activism and reform will be necessary to truly fix our biggest problems, so we might as well start as soon as possible! Starting a political party is itself very low-risk, especially since in the early stages it will be small and funding constrained.

It's also quite easy, since filing the necessary paperwork isn't a serious obstacle. We'll just have to wait for software systems capable of holding Persistent votes for a top-level constitution, and then anyone who's interested can either volunteer their time or pay dues to gain membership and the accompanying voting weights.

The beauty of a persistently democratic political party is that it can be and do whatever we want. As long as it's all legal, members can vote for constitutions to structure the party any way, and pursue any kind of action or activism imaginable. Here are some ideas I came up with:

- Hold a persistent vote for the [party platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_platform). Most political parties have the platform constructed by senior party leadership, who may or may not be at all accountable to members of the party.
- Nominate candidates for real political elections (obviously). Excitingly, depending on what's allowed by law, the party could require winning candidates to vote according to persistent votes conducted by party members, making these candidates literal conduits for Persistent Democracy into real governments.
- Elect "mock" legislation documents and officials, representing what the party members would vote for if a real government used Persistent Democracy.
- Conduct [Persistent Funding](/persistent-funding) and [assurance contract grants](/intellectual-property-and-assurance-contracts) to fund projects members believe are worthwhile. These projects could be anything, from community gardens to neighborhood meal programs to open source research.
- Coordinate and fund other immediate activist efforts. Since Persistent Democracy is much more complex than most existing governments could currently implement, I personally think [approval voting](https://electionscience.org/library/approval-voting/) should be implemented in real elections right away. That kind of activism could be coordinated by members of this party.
- Hold social events. Why not???

Many specific systems, such as Common Resource Rights, aren't strictly necessary in order to practice Persistent Democracy. Any political entity using Persistent Democracy would be free to pick and choose some of these less core aspects. Persistent Democracy wouldn't remove disagreement and make practicing members into a monolith, it would just help negotiate disagreement productively. The party platform would depend entirely on what party members wanted, and it's possible *multiple* independent persistently democratic political parties could arise.

Here are some detail chapters discussing ideas *I personally* would agitate for inclusion in the party platform, and hopefully eventually for inclusion in the actual government.

and of course, wouldn't it be nice just to merge with an existing party instead of making a new one! of course, the requirement of a completely persistently democratic structure is a hard line we shouldn't be willing to cross, so any organization we merge with would have to take up that idea
in terms of membership structure, it seems simple, because any cooperative must ask its members to support the cooperative in some way, members either pay some set membership dues or do some kind of volunteering. these two things could be compensated using the [user defined organization](TODO) mechanism, where paying membership dues or performing volunteer hours grants decaying weights. there should be a limit to the maximum monthly dues, if we're going to try to court larger donations the benefits should only be intangible and social in nature. the constitutional kernel can define a maximum monthly donation and set a hardcoded hourly amount of weights for volunteering.
members gain voting rights, and can come to member meetings and gatherings.

there are lots of decisions to make, and I don't think the best way for them to be figured out is for me to sit alone and try to figure them all out.

## Persistently Democratic consumer cooperative

Political activism absolutely won't be enough. Large corporations and wealthy plutocrats have seized way too much power over both material resources and our political institutions for us to think we can make change in that arena.

To have any real hope of reforming our societies, we have to regain our economic power. We have to engage in *economic* activism, using democratic structures to retake enough land, resources, and capital that we can stand head to head with the existing corporate behemoths. Only then can we change our laws and take away the unfair advantages those corporate behemoths used to gain their position.

Cooperatives are the tool we can use to pursue economic activism. Importantly, cooperatives with modest visions who only operate on a local scale won't be enough to change things, since many of the most important economic systems we need to reclaim are unavoidably sweeping in their scale.

Once Persistent Democracy Labs has created the tools necessary to operate persistently democratic organizations, I will be founding a consumer cooperative with the core mission of using technology, automation, and economic scale to cooperativize every supply chain that is critical to human prosperity.

However, for now I'm going to leave these plans vague. It's too early to make any concrete promises, and frankly it doesn't seem productive to reveal things that could be used to hamper our efforts.

We have to stop waiting for our government to be reformed to start changing things. building our own private organization is something we don't have to ask permission for, and no one can stop us without stopping all the other private organizations as well.

<!-- our cooperative constitutions should disallow dissolving, selling, or demutualizing the entity. the constitutional kernel should enshrine persistent democracy irrevocably, so the only way for this organization to die is for it to lose all its members -->

We need to be clever and ruthless. If the laws set aside for cooperatives are nothing more than a playpen meant to control our efforts, then we'll ignore the playpen and fight the corporations on their own terms. If the law privileges the formation of for-profit companies, then we'll make a company that's for-profit in name only, and stubbornly enshrine our cooperative values in its articles of incorporation and bylaws.

Corporations have used unfair laws to steal the power of logic, science, technology, and industrial scale away from us. Many think those tools are inherently dangerous or corrosive, but that's not true. Science and scale aren't the problem, profit-seeking ownership and control is the problem. If we democratically use those powerful tools then we can point them towards shared prosperity and real human flourishing instead of short-sighted extraction.

We have an opportunity to create a new kind of cooperative. It doesn't seem to me like cooperatives are aggressive enough about expanding to further serve their members. I want to create an *activist* cooperative, one with the explicit mission of attacking corporatism and consumerism in all its forms and comprehensively improving its members lives by expanding into ever more sectors of the economy.





there are many annoying legal questions to answer. if the laws about cooperatives made sense we'd just make a single organization and be done with it. but we might have to do something tricky, like have a separate research and development company that's paid by a credit union, and R&D company is chartered to be governed by the wishes of members in the credit union?


I'm looking for help. I'm especially looking for:

- A legal engineer. I don't use the word lawyer because I don't want someone who thinks the law is immutable or unnavigable. I don't want someone who'll say *if* something can be done, I want someone who'll figure out *how* it can be done. There are many tricky aspects to navigating the law, and I need someone sharp and determined who can lead the fight in hacking through the jungle.
- A designer. someone with keen sense of style who knows how to make things beautiful. no particular specialties are required, but you have to be able to learn and adapt and apply your eye to different domains quickly, and learn new tools to better collaborate with engineers.

I'm looking for awesome people, people who learn fast, have passion for this work, who have a track record of doing things they aren't required to do, and who are true believers in democracy and shared prosperity.

I'm not sure what to build first! It would be nice to start with something that people are already willing to pay for, something where early adopters are already present, something that either hasn't been built already or the existing for-profit versions don't have real moats (social media seems like it has moats, but honestly the services have all become so poisonous that the moat is meaningless at this point)





I want to bring some startup energy to cooperatives! I want to be intense and determined and monomaniacally focused on achieving these goals. I don't want to work with people who just want a chill job where it's fun to hang out with your coworkers. if you haven't noticed, I'm exactly the opposite of chill! I'm super intense!


I don't know how to do any of these things (fundraising, operations management, financial modeling, market research, design), but I do know how to build all levels of a robust web application, and a fair amount about formal verification.

- journalism and news media
- social media and internet forums
- grocery stores/junk food producers
- internet service providers
- cloud computing

surveillance and recommender systems. the social problems created by large tech firms, especially those related to media and information, have become pressing and obvious. many people discuss how to solve these problems by somehow reforming the companies or regulations, but I think the *real* solution to these problems is quite obvious, cooperative ownership. the real problem at the heart of problematic companies of all kinds (not only tech companies) is the incentives of the companies aren't aligned with those of their customers or society at large. cooperative ownership directly solves the problem of alignment with customers (since they are the owning decision-makers), and obliquely solves the problem of alignment with society since membership in a cooperative is open.
