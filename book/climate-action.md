Climate Action: understanding the rigorous path forward



This is a big scary one, but many of the ideas presented in the previous sections can help a lot.

- We probably can't curb the problem only with reduction of consumption. We really do almost certainly need some technical breakthroughs to produce some multiplying factor. However we can get those breakthroughs by leveraging our new externality taxation systems and democratic budgets to increases taxes on carbon emitters, and use those resources to pour into public research and quadratic funding of initiatives and crowdsells. It's obviously more desirable to figure out solutions that enable continued increases in prosperity, so that's certainly the gold standard. Unfortunately it seems it will just take too long and be too difficult to curb this problem only through

- The most likely thing that will save us is safe, clean, abundant nuclear power. The first version is to make some form of fission safe/clean/abundant, such as designs that use thorium or use uranium/plutonium but can use old waste rods or don't produce waste. And we should lean into whatever things already exist.

- Liquid hydrogen is showing more promise, *if* we can get clean sources of electricity.

- We should however increase the strength of our environmental regulations (see democratic regulation above), as well as the strength of our laws about fraud, and delegation of crimes (by corporate boards/managers). The right not to be defrauded should be much more serious than we currently take it, and it seems reasonable to fairly aggresively fine/prosecute corporations/individuals whose actions led to the current unacceptable status quo.

- "un-carring" the economy, sponge cities, the urban garden/forest, and generally ways of thinking about design and urban planning to make cities both more beautiful and healthier and more sustainable
- fully inverting the university, and blending industry and academia in a fully fluid and therefore efficient and eudaimonia producing blend of theoretical and applied work. universities are massive co-working spaces, and the companies gain access both to laboratories and equipment as well as the ability of their staff to learn and take classes and speak with professors and researchers and to switch back and forth between industry and academia at will. also see above member cooperatives, because the next generation of universities can be owned by their faculty/the community/students/companies.
