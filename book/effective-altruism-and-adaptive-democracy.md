most big problems require big coordination

---

## adaptive democracy as a force multiplier

- comparable to other "meta" efforts in terms of expected impact
- better coordination systems help solve every other problem
- democratic ethics are very compatible with EA
- bootstrapping cooperatives should receive EA funding

## better coordination systems help solve every other problem

- global health and development (improve governance and coordination)
- climate change, biosecurity and pandemic prevention, nuclear security (global coordination and new public goods)
- space governance (adaptive constitutions and common resource rights)

<v-click>

- AI alignment
  - superhuman AI precipice (improve governance and deliberation)
  - **automation precipice**

it's pretty obvious most global health and development problems are really just examples of coordination failure and resource inequality, and it should be pretty obvious the only truly robust and scalable solutions to those problems are ones that allow the effected people to coordinate to solve the problems themselves.

pretty obvious relationship, these all require global coordination and new public goods

adaptive constitutions and common resource rights could very plausibly govern a global or multi-planet society. the fluidity of these systems would make it quite straightforward to decide how to divide space resources, either by placing them into shared public governance as is done with things like national parks, or simply using markets driven by common resource rights to fluidly decide ownership.

## automation precipice

- even weak AI could still render most people economically useless and militarily powerless
- concentration of this power in too few hands could cause many problems
- ethically precarious for many reasons

<v-click>

- adaptive democracy could plausibly cooperativize ownership of AI systems
- could ensure benefits are widely shared

## cooperative bootstrapping should receive EA funding

- grants for research and infrastructure
- low or zero interest loans for scaling
- scaled cooperatives are self-sustaining

cooperative bootstrapping is a massively scalable project

<!--
cooperatives have the potential to indirectly solve many other societal problems. wealth inequality and corporate misalignment have many knock-on effects in terms of how they negatively impact culture and deliberation and values and global health. for example, a facet of problems like obesity is the fact food manufacturers have misaligned incentives.

this is where EA organizations (or any altruistic organizations) have the opportunity to step in. if we can get a critical mass of cooperatives to the point where they're operating at scale, then we can be fairly confident they can take it from there. this means grants or low or zero interest loans to scaling cooperatives is a very good impact investment
in general I think adaptive democracy is a very convincing EA initiative. EA has generally centered around utilitarian ethics and a desire to maximize welfare, and I can think of few better ways to do so than to improve coordination efficiency in a way that allows any person to fairly express their preferences.
I have much more specific theoretical claims about the possible welfare optimality of adaptive democracy, and I'll make those in my next talk. I think there's a strong chance adaptive democracy is optimal
