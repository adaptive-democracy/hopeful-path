## Wealth Taxes

Let's imagine a society with one extremely wealthy person, and a bunch of poor people. Let's say the government in this society fully enforces a naive idea of property rights. Let's say this society is democratic, even adaptively democratic, but its constitution prevents taxes from taking an unequal percentage of wealth from any member.
It's pretty obvious the extremely wealthy person will be the dictator of this society, regardless of the democratic structure. If a very wealthy person can pay most of society 3x their yearly income every year for as long as they keep doing whatever the wealthy person says, then whatever they want will happen. Even if people get tired of them, it will be easy for that person to just buy out enough of the group or the collaborators of the group, so their strength won't be enough to actually do anything.
An even simpler statement: how many people with guns, or people operating the justice system, can this person buy off?

We're also assuming that if someone was really able to accrue that much wealth, it wasn't because they really made that massive a marginal contribution to society. They did it by leveraging some vulnerability in our systems of ownership that allowed them to exert undue leverage over others. A tax like this is the failsafe mechanism, something that will always kick in and correct things if we don't happen to catch something at a lower level.

a bunch of our tax designs suck, partially because they're regressive and unfair, but mostly because they're so easy to evade. income taxes are particularly really stupid. obviously because of the capital gains loophole, but also just because making an income isn't an inherently externality producing event. making income doesn't impose any burden on society.


The idea is to structure a continuous S curve function such that the inflection point in the curve represents a safe level of wealth, an amount that doesn't give the owner enough social power to distort markets or institutions, because they don't have enough marginal leverage over others.
we want the curve to reshape according to the inequality and purchasing power, or the amount of latent marginal leverage, in the society. so if a society has corrected and is healthy, then wealth taxes aren't as much of a thing
if someone makes $10,000, and someone offers them a bribe of $50,000, then the offerer kinda owns this person now. they're offering to move them from crippling poverty to merely laborious poverty. in contrast if someone makes $100,000 and they're offered a bribeof $50,000, then that's attractive sure, but that person can much more easily say "eh, I'm good" if there's something unsavory or troubling about the offer. it is more likely they're more worried about social standing or other intangible things than the person with $10,000
the presence of extremely desperate people alongside extremely wealthy people is literally dangerous for everyone.

I'm not sure what math makes this all make sense, I'm more proposing an interesting set of principles and a design challenge
