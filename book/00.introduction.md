**Humanity is headed toward a cliff, and we have no choice but to change course.**

People of different political persuasions fight endlessly about exactly *what's* wrong, and what we should do to fix it, but I think most of us agree, *something* needs to be done.

Here are the issues I personally am most concerned about:

- **Government inefficiency and corruption.** Almost no government is truly representative and democratic, many are outright authoritarian, and basically all have serious problems with waste, sluggishness, and graft.

- **Police unaccountability and systemic injustice.** Crime and punishment in almost all societies is an expression of class power structures rather than the democratic will to defend everyone's rights.

- **Economic inequality, consumerism, corporatism.** Our economies are dominated by massive corporations, who instead of creating prosperity gain power by finding and exploiting vulnerabilities, such as those in political institutions, human psychology, or market dynamics. Using the leverage of [cumulative advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect) these companies slowly form oligopolies and control an ever increasing share of technology and resources.

- **Climate change, environmental destruction.** Erratic and severe weather patterns are already beginning to disrupt communities and create increased resource uncertainty. We routinely destroy natural resources that both underpin our planet's economic value and are irreplaceably beautiful.

- **Misinformation, disinformation, surveillance capitalism.** It is now trivially easy for any group with spare resources to pollute our shared information ecosystem with misunderstandings or outright lies. The structure of attention capitalism rewards these kinds of behaviors and increasingly addicts us all to a world of shallow entertainment and consumerist indulgence.

- **Resurgence of fascism and authoritarianism.** The success of various social justice movements around the world and increased economic instability have empowered a new wave of reactive fascist movements, and many governments have eagerly adopted technological methods of surveillance and control. Violent and irrational forms of market and social fundamentalism have been deeply inculcated into many populations.

- **New technologies and future uncertainty.** The increasing reality of incredibly powerful technologies such as strong AI or widespread bio-engineering have caused many to fear about the continued *existence* of our society, let alone its continued health and happiness. As our species builds ever more dangerous technologies here on earth, and as we begin to venture out to the stars, we have more and more cause for concern.

You're welcome to disagree about the details of those fears, but you don't have to look far to find strong evidence for all of them.

How can we possibly solve all these problems? Each of them individually would be incredibly dangerous and destructive, but they overlap in devilish ways. Each reinforces and exacerbates the others, tying the whole collection into a paralyzing Gordian knot. This is impossible right?

I don't think this is impossible. Rather I think the intertwined nature of these problems isn't an obstacle, but the secret to solving them all.

I am convinced these problems are all *coordination problems*. They have arisen because we lack effective *tools* to help us work together and resolve conflicts.

Let me show you why I'm convinced, and why I think we can solve all these problems and more.

# Coordination Systems

Cooperation is humanity's superpower.

From the very beginning of our history as hunter-gatherers, the capability that set us apart from other animals was our ability to work together to achieve shared goals. It's not that we *could* cooperate (many other animals cooperate in many ways), but our ability to pursue *complex* cooperation, to encode arbitrary information and plans in language and then act using that information.

All our modern prosperity is rooted in our ability to cooperate. The achievements of science and technology are only possible through cooperation. Passing down a culture is an act of cooperation that can continue for many generations. Our complex societies are made possible using governments and organizations that help us cooperate more effectively.

But as much as we've empowered ourselves using complex rules for cooperation, we seem continually frustrated when we try to *scale democracy*. Democracy is simply giving all members of a group an equal amount of decision-making power, and many people believe such a thing isn't even possible at scale. So in practice we end up with creaky hodge-podges of fairly arbitrary rules which are easily exploited by small cadres of insiders and never seem to operate fairly, efficiently, and in the best interest of all.

We don't need creaky and arbitrary rules cooked up by politicians hundreds of years ago.

Coordination systems are just algorithms, which means *they can be improved*.

The term *algorithm* has taken on a spooky quality in the era of massive technology companies, but the concept isn't inherently dangerous. An algorithm is just a list of instructions intended to produce some outcome. All of us use algorithms all the time, such as when we follow a recipe or do some specific exercise routine.

Voting systems are just algorithms. Small groups of people usually find it easy to find some consensus they all find acceptable just by reading each other's emotions and talking and coming to understand each other. But when too many people must be involved in a decision, there's too much noise and we can't possibly follow our natural algorithm.

![](/drawing-1-noise.png)

Voting systems were invented to solve this problem. Since we can't extensively interview every single voter, understand what they want, and simply combine everyone's preferences into a decision, we simplify the process. A voting system presents each voter with a discrete list of options to choose from and adds up the votes.

![](/drawing-2-voting.png)

Since voting systems are just algorithms, they have a precise mathematical structure that can be studied. This means it's possible to *prove* things about an algorithm with the same certainty we know `1 + 1 = 2`.

It's possible to prove one algorithm is superior to another in some way ([sorting a list of items this way is faster than that way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)). It's even possible to prove an algorithm is *optimal* in some way, meaning it's impossible to do better in that particular way ([stacking incoming items in this way is the best you could possibly do](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05740)).

This means it's possible to *design* better coordination systems. Academic fields such as [political economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy) and [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) study these questions, and try to come up with systems that perform better in different ways.

I'm not telling you this because math and logic are all we'll ever need, or that they've already solved all our problems. Logical theories can only reason about imaginary *models* of the real world. While they can help us avoid wasting time on clearly flawed experiments and point us toward possibilities we would never bump into with experiments alone, we still need to perform experiments to see if our imaginary logical models usefully align with reality.

I'm telling you this is because it offers a *hopeful path*, a clear demonstration our problems are less devilishly tangled than we thought. That it's possible for us to use the same tools we've used for thousands of years, logic and experimentation, to get ourselves out of our current mess.

I was first introduced to this possibility when I encountered [Aaron Hamlin discussing Approval Voting and how it could dramatically improve our democracy](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/aaron-hamlin-voting-reform/), and [Glen Weyl discussing Quadratic Voting/Funding and other ideas espoused by the RadicalXChange foundation](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/glen-weyl-radically-reforming-capitalism-and-democracy/). Both these scholars proposed fixes to problems I thought were merely inevitable in a democratic society. They opened up my thinking and helped me realize "democracy" is a pretty flexible idea, one that can be achieved in many different ways. It is possible for us to *implement* democracy better. I was excited about Hamlin's and Weyl's ideas, and I learned as much as I could about them and other related ideas.

But I slowly became convinced no one had fixed the problem *enough*. No one had presented a *complete* system for coordinating a democratic society, one that had the flexibility to allow an arbitrarily large group of people to cooperate without the need for creaky arbitrary rules and cadres of insiders.

I think I've developed the foundation of such a system, the central concept of this book, called **Persistent Democracy**.

# Persistent Democracy

Persistent Democracy uses a different paradigm of voting, called Persistent Voting, which isn't a voting *method*, but a different way of thinking about voting entirely. Persistent Voting is my best guess at a system that would allow truly flexible and scalable **direct democracy**, one that could possibly abolish the concept of politicians entirely, and allow any size of group to democratically coordinate in arbitrarily flexible ways. A few key features make it so promising:

- Elections aren't time-limited events with arbitrary deadlines, but instead voters have a supply of voting *weights* they can shift around at any time.
- Voters can vote *more strongly* for issues they care more about, or vote *against* things they dislike even when they aren't sure what the right answer is.
- Voters can potentially vote *directly* for any societal decision, even documents like the constitution or tax code, without being overwhelmed by millions of decisions they don't care about.

This book exists to present and explain Persistent Democracy, to explore the ways it can be used to combine, evolve, and generalize many different coordination systems, and plot a practical and realistic course to actually apply it.

Whenever I speak with idealistic people about the world, I almost always find them in a state of despair. Many have thrown up their hands and given up even trying. I can't help but sympathize. The obstacles ahead are overwhelming, and most aren't our fault.

But here's the thing: *we don't have any choice*. If we don't solve these problems, they will steadily dismantle our society, and possibly destroy us entirely.

**We have the *obligation* of hope.** If we don't, perhaps arrogantly, assume we can figure it out, overcome these challenges, and make a better world, then our failure is a foregone conclusion. We have to start asking *how* we can solve these problems, not *if* we can solve them. Persistent Democracy and this book is my first contribution, and a gathering point I hope will inspire others.

# An overview of the book

This book isn't structured in the typical way. Since a discussion of coordination systems can easily get extremely wonky and detailed, this book is structured similarly to a tree with many small branches, rather than a typical "straight line" book. There are only four main chapters, meaning pretty much anyone can get the big ideas in a single sitting. However all chapters freely point to other "detail" chapters for those interested. The book is published as a website to accommodate the tree structure.

This book is open source, and a work in progress. [This "tree" will continue to grow.](https://blainehansen.me/post/iterative-media/) Anyone is free to suggest edits or additions by [submitting a pull request on the book's online repository](https://github.com/blainehansen/hopeful-pathway).

Here are the main chapters:

<!-- TODO make a special component to show these as buttons -->

- [**Persistent Democracy**](TODO) discusses the central concept, how it can enable direct democracy, and some important details it needs to work properly.
- [**Partial Common Ownership**](TODO) discusses how Persistent Democracy can be blended with Harberger taxes to maintain the useful aspects of private property while breaking cycles of cumulative advantage and ensuring resources tend to be used for socially beneficial purposes.
- [**The Power of Cooperatives**](TODO) discusses how cooperatives can use Persistent Democracy to finally meet their full potential, and allow us to build a fair and sustainable economy without waiting for government reform.
- [**Making Persistent Democracy Real**](TODO) discusses how a political party and a consumer cooperative both governed using Persistent Democracy can allow us to validate Persistent Democracy in the real world, and slowly take back control of our economies and governments.

The [table of contents](/contents) lists all finished detail chapters. Here are some particularly interesting ones:

- [Why is our democracy broken? An introduction to voting methods and their rippling consequences.](TODO)
- [Software is too important to be constantly broken. Provably correct software is possible and necessary.](TODO)
- [Blockchains aren't going to fix society, but Persistent Democracy and cooperatives could.](TODO)

## Footnote: is Persistent Democracy provably optimal?

Maybe! I've developed some [very rough work-in-progress proof sketches](TODO) that are convincing enough to start sharing the idea and building experimental tools.

I'm a skilled software engineer capable of immediately building usable implementations of Persistent Democracy, so it wouldn't be the most effective use of my time to gain the background necessary to create proofs the academic community would actually accept. I hope my proof sketches are interesting enough for daring academics to explore further! Please reach out to me if you decide to do this!
