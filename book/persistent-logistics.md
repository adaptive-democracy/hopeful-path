incorporate constitutional merging



The largest difficulty in implementing persistent democracy is enabling every voter to update any of their votes at any time. In private organizations like member cooperatives that can simply assume all members can vote through the internet, and where the stakes aren't quite as high, this isn't a serious difficulty. But for a government with citizens spread across a large geographic area, it becomes quite challenging.

It should be immediately obvious all the voting methods I've described in this book absolutely must be counted and stored digitally. The idea of election officials having to manually validate and track a persistently incoming stream of paper Quadratic Range ballots and Democratic Weights udpates is just ridiculous. It's tempting then to simply perform all voting over the internet, and this would be more reasonable with a broadband [universal service obligation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_service). However there is one very good reason not to make this decision even if an internet voting system could be made available, accessible, and secure.

## Verified identity is critical with Quadratic systems.

Quadratic voting systems of all kinds count votes differently depending on how many individuals they came from, and votes from more people can add up to the same total vote much more cheaply. The incentive to somehow gain access to extra fraudulent identities is therefore much stronger.

However it's also true [voter identification laws have historically been used to discriminate](https://www.aclu.org/other/oppose-voter-id-legislation-fact-sheet). By unfairly disadvantaging those with fewer resources, less time, a longer distance to travel to licensing offices, missing documents, or documents made less carefully by previous institutions, a class of people can essentially be denied their right to vote. If we're going to universally require verified identity, we have to make it possible and tractable for everyone.

The obvious first choice is to make acquiring identification completely free. But to address the bulk of the remaining issues we need something more comprehensive.

## A network of small voting offices.

The country is already dotted by a network of postal offices, a necessity since the United States Postal Service is required by law to serve every address in the nation. This network could be fairly easily adapted to also house small voting offices. These offices would be open all year at broad but reasonable hours depending on the location. They would have computer voting machines, and to ensure their software was the most secure and intuitively designed available, their software would be [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model) and selected by democratically elected officials. These voting machines could be used to view and update all a voter's democratic weight allocations and any accompanying ballots, print paper manifests of current weights and ballots to act as a receipt, and view all available elections.

Each office would have one or more voting clerks, democratically elected or appointed by someone who is. These clerks' main responsibility would be to act as a "proctor" or witness for the office. But they would also help voters who don't understand the voting machines by printing out their manifests, giving them educational materials about how the voting systems work, and providing scannable paper ballots if requested. These offices would also act as identification bureaus, making the tractability of voting and acquiring identification equivalent.

To properly serve those who are incapacitated or live very far away, we could provide a "mail lifeline" to interact with these voting/postal offices. A voter could send letter requests for paper manifests and ballots, or requests for a group of voting clerks to visit them at their residence to give them identification.

I've already advocated for residency granting citizenship, so the only requirements to gain identification would be to demonstrate residence, give basic information about yourself, and have a photo taken. To demonstrate residence these offices could mail verification codes to someone's stated address and have them bring the code into the office, or a group of voting clerks could pick up the code when they visit.

Verifying *uniqueness* of identity is a more difficult problem. This is [an area of active research](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/papers/verifying-identity-as-a-social-intersection.pdf), and will likely take a much more complicated mechanism to robustly enforce. The best we can do without such a mechanism is to make it merely more annoying and costly to acquire *and use* more than one identity. If voting clerks give each voter a [one-time code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce) after checking their identification, the voter would have to come in on a separate occasion to actually use a non-unique identity. And if people can make accusations of duplicate identity to be resolved through a trial mechanism, then at least acquiring and using duplicate identities would carry some risk. These methods would likely be sufficient if most voting happens in person.

## Persistent Democracy makes hurdles less serious.

It's important to point out, any logistical hurdles someone might face while trying to vote are a much less serious problem in a Persistent Democracy. Our existing elections present rigid date windows during which voters must clear any logistical hurdles or risk losing the chance to participate.

But in a Persistent Democracy they can gradually clear these hurdles and thereafter fit voting trips into their schedule as their life unfolds. The elections they wish to participate in will still be there once they're able.

## Making voting offices cost-effective.

Voting offices would of course be tax-funded with the purpose of serving an essential public good, so they wouldn't be required to sustain themselves financially. However if we can make them more efficient without interfering with their purpose, we should be eager to do so.

The best ways to reduce these costs are with increased digital automation, and consolidation of more "in-person" governmental functions into these offices. Driver licensing, other permitting bureaus, courthouses, libraries, and community meeting spaces could all be examples.

universal voluntary constitution, is it possible to do this without being imperial?


The construct of the nation state is harmful and dangerous in many ways. Different nation states define completely different definitions of human rights, and have wildly different governance models. Borders between countries harm the human rights of any who would wish to cross them, and create immense economic and social inefficiencies.

If we're really truly confident our systems of rights and governance are fair and voluntary, we would like a way for anyone in the world to voluntarily bring themselves under our constitution. The difficulty of doing this is that previous nations who have defined systems like this have essentially always used them as a moral shield for imperialist ambitions. The question we have is if it's possible to define a system that actually structurally promises that any area who uses the expansion system to become part of our constitution has done so because there is a legitimate and voluntary desire from the people of that area to do so.

# Description

We've already shared our hope of creating verified and provably optimal philosophical frameworks for understanding consciousness, utility, rights, and voting systems. If we were able to produce such frameworks and really have such an unimpeachably high confidence in their universal correctness, we would greatly desire to see them implemented for all conscious beings.

However, this is very dangerous territory. The desire to spread a particular cultural idea that a group has high confidence in has many times in history been an excuse to pursue imperialism and oppress others.

How can we transcend nationalism while at the same time allowing a pluralistic society? What limits should we place on intervening to prevent human rights abuses in other countries?

We feel that the only way to possibly justify "annexing" a portion of land as part of a unified society is if the inhabitants of that land demonstrate clear democratic will to do so. This is tricky though, since by definition these people are outside our society, we have to have some way of verifying them and their wishes. If we
What rituals can we use for citizens of a neighboring country to say they want to join? How do we know what land
Does it make sense to make the nature of the rituals such that they can't really be done in wartime? Probably not, since disgruntled people could just start conflicts to prevent joining.
Also how do we do it in a way that allows the *people* to demonstrate their democratic will rather than relying on the existing government?
Maybe we just accept that a people who really wants to join but has a government that prevents the rituals simply has to overthrow their government first? That's frustrating, and it makes us prone to prod along that kind of activity.

Perhaps it's this simple:

- We state that any country neighbors ours can join us as a distinct administrative district. When that happens, we have certain types of officials that we send to help the new country establish it's systems of democratic decision making, and convert any old structures for that use. They of course can then change their districts, fluidly merging in whatever natural way with democratic borders.
- We need some kind of ritual for verifying new voters, and we should always even be using it within the existing society. Since such a ritual would almost certainly hinge on some kind of rotational vouching system, and we need some root of trust. The officials we send would perform an initial vouching ritual with some initial group of people. Since the vouching system merely requires people to make a single trip to a voting office and be vouched, it could spread through the new land fairly quickly, and all people could gradually become vouched.
Is it crazy to use biometrics?

Maybe joining would be contingent on the vouching process? Perhaps we simply set up some initial seed office with trusted officials and vouch new people and slowly create more ad hoc such offices as the vouching proceeds, and only once we feel the vouching has got past a certain level of confidence do we consider the area joined?



By allowing *all* immigration into the society merely requiring registration of all entrants, and making residence the only requirement for citizenship, we create a society that will tend to win simply if it performs well. If we truly believe that our systems are fair and will produce greatest prosperity, we should be confident that more people entering our society from others will put pressure on other societies to change themselves to be more fair or to simply join ours.
