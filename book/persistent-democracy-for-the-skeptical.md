title: "Persistent Democracy for the skeptical"
subtitle: "Some form of Democracy is an ethical imperative. But it still must be safe, sane, and efficient."

it's a massive moral error to simply assume democracy can't work, because democracy can mean many different things.

there are a few major concepts or paradigms that are bundled together in Persistent Democracy:

- resource voting
- score voting
- Persistent Voting
  - possible objection: won't that be unstable? no, because of stabilization buckets
  - possible objection: won't everyone vote all the time and it be stressful? no, because of update rhythms
- electing complete documents rather than doing amendments
  - can have a truly direct democracy but still benefit from delegation and expertise
- maximizing the efficiency of a resource allocation using the harberger tax concept

let's say some group of experts decides on some policy, but then a broad swath of people are sufficiently opposed to it that they choose to place some of a limited number of weights to prevent it. do you really believe that despite the fact that they could have used those weights to try to get lower taxes (or any other number of things) that they're being irrational? or is it that the decision was made without all the necessary knowledge, or without the necessary transparency?
it is extremely paternalistic to assume some small cadre of experts should simply make the decisions and not have to defend those decisions to those who will be effected by them. if people are willing to sacrifice influence in all other areas to signal a preference in one area, that *by definition* demonstrates the decision as understood by those who will be effected by it will be a negative decision.
here's the really big thing: in practice democracy *will still be largely technocratic*, because people don't care! people will signal for things they care about, and be completely fine delegating decisions when they don't care. and then *when delegated experts cause problems*, everyone has the opportunity to immediately use transparency to correct those problems.
if experts are incapable of persuading people with various
yes people will choose things they believe will best satisfy their preferences, and people will have contradictory preferences. that's why we vote! we vote both to determine which sets of preferences will be satisfied in which ways at which times, and what course of action will actually achieve that result
we can't escape from the need to explain things and argue. all we can do is somehow make that requirement *good faith*, by requiring a sacrifice of a scarce resource in order to make your argument.

it seems much more plausible problems in our politics are *symptoms* of bad coordination mechanisms, not *causes*
people don't vote because they legitimately have no voice and the offered choices are equally unacceptable to them
people make a dishonest amount of fuss about things because it's strategically cheap for them to do so and they slightly prefer it
people don't have a way to say "no not this", but have to vote *for* something they may feel is simply less unacceptable
people vote "straight party ticket" because the results of almost all offered elections are legitimately unimportant to them but it's strategically easy to do
media organizations
political parties
in such systems it is *strategically rational* to pursue motivated reasoning and lie to oneself in order to align with a party, and therefore have a real voice

yes there will be awful people voting, but they already are. the entire motivation of voting is to let all the contradictions in opinion cancel each other out and get distilled to something reasonable. systems like plurality voting do a terrible job of this, but resource/score voting systems are provably better

representative democracy is unethical, it's almost impossible to say otherwise. unless selection of representatives is truly structurally equal, they won't actually be representative

how does "representative democracy" do anything to address the problem of an "irrational" electorate? an irrational electorate will simply elect irrational representatives.
it's not "direct" democracy we should care about, it's *actual* democracy. representative democracy is just a codeword for "not actually a democracy".

it would be unwise to experiment immediately in our governments. we must first validate Persistent Democracy in *private* organizations, ones where the stakes aren't as high as they are in government (examples could be clubs, online communities, cooperatives, homeowners associations, etc). refer to this page to get the details

yes this would absolutely require electronic voting. we already massively rely on the correctness of many software systems, this is an improvement that must happen regardless and is closer than you think
also, we already rely on software all the time. this is a strawman argument, because surely you don't think software should never be used in situations where it matters, as proven by things like aeronautic control software or banking software or even existing *voting* software! yes these systems have errors, yes it's impossible to completely remove errors (although verification systems could get us basically as close as anything could ever be to perfect), but we still consider that risk of error worth the massive benefits the software gives us. the same would be true for a different voting system if the voting methods were truly that superior
please refer to the magmide project to hear my argument that widely adopted verified software isn't several massive technical breakthroughs away, but is instead a series of modest usability improvements and distillation away.
