Persuasive Action: deradicalization and stopping weaponized unreality


We're trundling towards a sectarian civil war, and we have to start actually persuading conservatives and pulling back from insanity. in order to do so, we have to be armed with legitimately reasonable and well-synthesized ideas for how to solve societal problems, and how all of these things should work. with such a reasonable platform that isn't just a warmed over version of ideas they've come to hate, we can actually make progress. after we have a strong base of reasonable ideas to espouse, then we need to do the detailed journalism/history of revealing to them in a very detailed and undeniable way how many of the lies they've been told are in fact lies. then with this incredibly detailed/well-researched/formally proven corpus of philosphies/histories/political mechanisms we need to find people within conservatism to spread these ideas and present them from the perspective of an ally and an "unpoisoned" voice, as well as to be fun and persuasive etc. we also have to begin to the do the work to demonstrate a few very important things to them:

- many of the ideologies they've fallen into are either inherently irrational and reality-denying or have a clear trail of being intentionally engineered by plutocrats in order to propagandize them, or are inherently morally bankrupt (ethnonationalism/fascism). (uselessness of "socialism" word and what a thought-terminating device it's been)

- many of the things they've been told about other people/the world/history are clearly demonstratable lies and have created an undefensible narrative in their minds. they're free to interepret facts however they see fit according to their ideologies, but they can't deny documented facts.

- this project is all about slowly building up our truth, starting from a base philosophy, then deriving from that base philosophy other philosophical ideas, as well as ways of discovering and vetting facts, then facts and concrete policy/economic/cultural proposals.

- also, we can start creating concrete resources for people trying to persuade others. and we can do our best to come up with "interventions" that are more than just sharing links, all trying to be effective and actually persuade people.




An idea for how to fix everything and deradicalizing the right, having explainers at progressive levels of detail, like a layer cake. The whole thing is anchored in primary sources, and the layers are basically just describing them and combining them
Each primary source, which would probably overwhelmingly be scientific papers and primary historical documents, could have brief explainers themselves

non-confrontational compassionate informational counter-protests?
