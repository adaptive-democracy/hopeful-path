I'm extremely grateful you've joined me as I share these ideas for a better world. I greatly appreciate your time and energy, and hope you can find time to give helpful feedback or contributions.

I'm working on the much more comprehensive next version of this book in the [repository's `book:next` folder](https://github.com/blainehansen/hopeful-pathway/tree/main/book:next). The work in that directory is very rough and ongoing. I intend to revisit this book often, and trust it will evolve far beyond my imagination.

I hope you'll join me in this shared endeavor, and that together we can make our world just and properous for all.
