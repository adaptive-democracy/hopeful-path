I'm extremely grateful you've joined me as I share these ideas for a better world. I greatly appreciate your time and energy, and hope you can find time to give helpful feedback or contributions.

I intend to revisit this book often, and trust it will evolve far beyond my imagination. My next phase of work will focus on formalizing and verifying the logical claims, starting with those about rights and voting.

I hope you'll join me in this shared endeavor, and that together we can make our world just and properous for all.
